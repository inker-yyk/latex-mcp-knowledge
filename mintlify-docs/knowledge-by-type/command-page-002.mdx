## 102. Command: `\pgfplotsinvokeforeach\marg{list`

**ID**: `5f4dae5c8409`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: command&#125; A variant of || (and such also of ||) which replaces any occurrence of |#1| inside of command once for every element in list. Thus, it actually assumes that command is like a || body. In other words, command is invoked for every element of list. The actual element of list is available as |#1|. As ||, this command does not introduce extra scopes (i.e.\@ it is ungrouped as well). The difference to | in |listcommand is subtle: the || would not be expanded whereas |#1| is. codeexample[] oth
