**ID**: `b6ab30c92b5f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the opacity of all operations, treating stroking and filling as a transparency group. Some drivers support this operations, others do not and set the fill and stroke individually. This difference can only be seen when a path is stroked and filled at the same time: When the drawing and fill opacities are set individually, the effect of filling and drawing a path at the same time is the same as first filling the path and then drawing it. On the other, if the opacity is set using this comman

## 724. Command: `\pgfsys@stroke@opacity\marg{value`

**ID**: `c5b43f95e49d`

**ID**: `ba8f32e5229e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification

**ID**: `446f8d3f69ee`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification

**ID**: `6155d66f24dc`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; ``Uses'' an id previously created using |@new@id|. This causes the next graphic object to get the id (not the current one).

**ID**: `0faafefb7afb`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

## 740. Command: `\pgfsys@begin@idscope`

**ID**: `78fe1ca7fa33`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Starts a (graphics) scope whose sole purpose is to assign it an id-type-pair so that it can be referenced later. Note that this command does not always produce a graphics scope: If no id is currently in use or if the id-type-pair has already been used, a graphic scope may or may not be created as defined by the driver (but always a \ scope). This allows drivers to minimize the number of graphic scopes created. When an id scope is created, any code that has been ``attached'' to it using |@attach@

The effect is that just before the id scope for this pair is created, the setup code is executed, then the scope is started, then the begin code is executed at the beginning, and, finally, end code gets executed just before the scope ends. Multiple calls of this macro accumulated.

**ID**: `f31329ccd7f4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf
