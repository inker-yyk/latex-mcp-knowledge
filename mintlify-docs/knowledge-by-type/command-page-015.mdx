---

## 757. Command: `\pgfsys@defobject\marg{name`

**ID**: `4a3a3f4e93b3`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: lower leftupper rightcode&#125; Declares an object for later use. The idea is that the object can be precached in some way and then be rendered more quickly when used several times. For example, an arrow head might be defined and prerendered in this way. The parameter name is the name for later use. lower left and upper right are \ points specifying a bounding box for the object. code is the code for the object. The code should not be too fancy. This command has a default implementation and need not 

---

## 758. Command: `\pgfsys@useobject\marg{name`

**ID**: `dcbf90effa3f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: extra code&#125; Renders a previously declared object. The first parameter is the name of the object. The second parameter is extra code that should be executed right before the object is rendered. Typically, this will be some transformation code. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

---

## 759. Command: `\pgfsys@marker@declare\marg{macro`

**ID**: `f90ac69d641a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; Declares a marker symbol for later use. The command is very similar to |@defobject|, but the use case is slightly different: The graphic object defined using the code is stored in such a way that it can be used as an arrow tip marker symbol in animations. The macro is set to an identifier by which the marker can be referenced later on. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

---

## 760. Command: `\pgfsys@marker@use\marg{macro`

**ID**: `658662b77e1d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

---

## 761. Command: `\pgfsys@begininvisible`

**ID**: `e7d7ac2370b2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Between this command and the closing |@endinvisible| all output should be suppressed. Nothing should be drawn at all, which includes all paths, images and shadings. However, no groups (neither \ groups nor graphic state groups) should be opened by this command. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 762. Command: `\pgfsys@endinvisible`

**ID**: `43634e629279`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Ends the invisibility section, unless invisibility blocks have been nested. In this case, only the ``last'' one restores visibility. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: height&#125; Inserts the necessary ||s for the current driver into the output stream to ``locally'' change the page size. Whether such a ``local'' change is possible depends strongly on the driver. For instance, |dvips| will honor the first call to this command that is part of the shipped-out document and will ignore all other uses. In contrast, |pdftex| will use the current value of the paper size for each page and, additionally, setting the papersize is local to the current \ group.

---

## 764. Command: `\pgfsys@global@papersize\marg{width`

**ID**: `2e0d3fe060e8`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

---

## 767. Command: `\pgfsys@markposition\marg{name`

**ID**: `68692af08271`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Marks a position on the page. This command should be given while normal typesetting is done such as in codeexample[code only] The value of $x$ is @markposition&#123;here&#125;important. codeexample It causes the position |here| to be saved when the page is shipped out.

---

---

## 770. Command: `\pgfpathsvg\marg{path`

**ID**: `20fa10f55fb4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command extends the current path by a path given in the svg-path-data syntax. This syntax is described in detail in Section~8.3 of the svg-specification, Version~1.1. In principle, the complete syntax is supported and the library just provides a parser and a mapping to basic layer commands. For instance, |M 0 10| is mapped to |&#123;0pt&#123;10pt&#125;&#125;|. There are, however, a few things to be aware of: itemize The computation underlying the arc commands |A| and |a| are not numerically stable, which may

**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Processes all options in exactly the same way as ||key--value-list, but a key filter is considered as soon as key identification is complete. The key filter tells || whether it should continue to apply the current option (return value is `true') or whether something different shall be done (filter returns `false'). There is exactly one key filter in effect, and it is installed by the |.install key filter| handler or by ||. If the key filter returns `false', a unique key filter handler gets con
