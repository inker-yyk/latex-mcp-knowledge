## 351. Command: `\pgfpathclose`

**ID**: `cd521805315e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command closes the current part of the path by appending a straight line to the start point of the current part. Note that there is a difference between closing a path and using the line-to operation to add a straight line to the start of the current path. The difference is demonstrated by the upper corners of the triangles in the following example: codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 5pt &#123;1cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;0cm&#123;-1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;1cm&#123;-1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;2.5cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;1.5cm&#123;-1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;2.5cm&#123;-1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;2.5cm

## 352. Command: `\pgfpatharc\marg{start angle`

**ID**: `4445c656d2b5`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: end angle&#123;`\&#123;&#125;radius| and |&#123;y-radius&#125;&#123;`\&#125;&#125;&#125; This command appends a part of a circle (or an ellipse) to the current path. Imagine the curve between start angle and end angle on a circle of radius radius (if $start angle &lt; end angle$, the curve goes around the circle counterclockwise, otherwise clockwise). This curve is now moved such that the point where the curve starts is the previous last point of the path. Note that this command will not start a new part of the path, which is important for ex

## 353. Command: `\pgfpatharcaxes\marg{start angle`

**ID**: `588298c30766`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: end anglefirst axissecond axis&#125; This command is similar to ||. The main difference is how the ellipse or circle is specified from which the arc is taken. The two parameters first axis and second axis are the $0^$-axis and the $90^$-axis of the ellipse from which the path is taken. Thus, |0&#123;90&#125;&#123;1cm and 2cm&#125;| has the same effect as verbatim 0&#123;90&#125;&#123;1cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125;&#123;0cm&#123;2cm&#125;&#125; verbatim codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); (0,0) -- (2cm,5mm) (0,0) -- (0cm,1cm); &#123;2cm&#123;5mm&#125;&#125; 0&#123;90&#125;&#123;2cm&#123;5mm&#125;&#125;&#123;0

## 354. Command: `\pgfpatharcto\marg{x-radius`

**ID**: `955277df1be9`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y-radiusrotation large arc flagcounterclockwise flag\ point&#125; This command (which directly corresponds to the arc-path command of svg) is used to add an arc to the path that starts at the current point and ends at target point. This arc is part of an ellipse that is determined in the following way: Imagine an ellipse with radii x-radius and y-radius that is rotated around its center by rotation degrees. When you move this ellipse around in the plane, there will be exactly two positions such that

## 355. Command: `\pgfpatharctoprecomputed\marg{center point`

**ID**: `393883fdce4f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: start angleend angleend point\-radiusy-radiusratio x-radius/y-radiusratio y-radius/x-radius&#125; A specialized arc operation which is fast and numerically stable, provided a lot of information is given in advance. In contrast to ||, it explicitly interpolates start and end points. In contrast to ||, this routine is numerically stable and quite fast since it relies on a lot of available information. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 1.5cm 1cm 0 270 1.5cm 0.5cm /= /= &#123;+*cos()&#123;+*

## 356. Command: `\pgfpathellipse\marg{center`

**ID**: `a36daab1d110`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: first axissecond axis&#125; The effect of this command is to append an ellipse to the current path (if the path is not empty, a new part is started). The ellipse's center will be center and first axis and second axis are the axis vectors. The same effect as this command can also be achieved using an appropriate sequence of move-to, arc, and close operations, but this command is easier and faster. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); &#123;1cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125; &#123;1.5cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125; &#123;0cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125; draw red &#123;1cm

## 360. Command: `\pgfpathgrid\oarg{options`

**ID**: `23ef5d81df7a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: first cornersecond corner&#125; Appends a grid to the current path. That is, a (possibly large) number of parts are added to the path, each part consisting of a single horizontal or vertical straight line segment. Conceptually, the origin is part of the grid and the grid is clipped to the rectangle specified by the first corner and the second corner. However, no clipping occurs (this command just adds parts to the current path) and the points where the lines enter and leave the ``clipping area'' are

## 361. Command: `\pgfpathparabola\marg{bend vector`

**ID**: `c4c0fcdc409f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: end vector&#125; This command appends two half-parabolas to the current path. The first starts at the current point and ends at the current point plus bend vector. At this point, it has its bend. The second half parabola starts at that bend point and ends at point that is given by the bend plus end vector. If you set end vector to the null vector, you append only a half parabola that goes from the current point to the bend; by setting bend vector to the null vector, you append only a half parabola th

## 364. Command: `\pgfsetcornersarced\marg{point`

**ID**: `ee1b8fd5ce92`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command causes all subsequent corners to be replaced by little arcs. The effect of this command lasts till the end of the current \ scope. The point dictates how large the corner arc will be. Consider a corner made by two lines $l$ and~$r$ and assume that the line $l$ comes first on the path. The $x$-dimension of the point decides by how much the line~$l$ will be shortened, the $y$-dimension of point decides by how much the line $r$ will be shortened. Then, the shortened lines are connect

**ID**: `4a78f2ba3909`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Once the core has been loaded, you can use this command to load further modules. The modules in the module names list should be separated by commas. Instead of curly braces, you can also use square brackets, which is something Con t users will like. If you try to load a module a second time, nothing will happen. |matrix,shapes| What this command does is to load the file |pgfmodule|module|.code.tex| for each module in the list of module names. Thus, to write your own module, all you need to do

**ID**: `9ae596170e73`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Determines whether the position of pictures on the page should be recorded. The value of this -if at the end of a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;| environment is important, not the value at the beginning. If this option is set to true of a picture, \ will attempt to record the position of the picture on the page. (This attempt will fail with most drivers and when it works, it typically requires two runs of .) The position is not directly accessible. Rather, the nodes mechanism will use this position if you access

## 372. Command: `\pgfsetbaseline\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `98091cbd72b2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command specifies a $y$-coordinate of the picture that should be used as the baseline of the whole picture. When a \ picture has been typeset completely, \ must decide at which height the baseline of the picture should lie. Normally, the baseline is set to the $y$-coordinate of the bottom of the picture, but it is often desirable to use a different height. codeexample[] Text pgfpicture &#123;1ex&#125;stroke pgfpicture, pgfpicture 0pt &#123;1ex&#125;stroke pgfpicture, pgfpicture .5ex &#123;1ex&#125;stroke pgfpicture, p

**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: name&#125; This command assigns a system layer identifier (the identifier returned by |@new@id|) to the macro, namely the one that will be used the next time || is used. You use this command for ``forward referencing''. A typical use case is the following: A key like |whom| for animations uses this command to get the system identifier that will be used for a future object. Then, this identifier can be passed to system layer commands like |@animation@whom|. Note that the ``next'' use need not be on th
