**ID**: `cfdff5fa9d3d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Environment Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This environment can be used to temporarily interrupt the construction of the current path. The effect will be that the path currently under construction will be ``stored away'' and restored at the end of the environment. Inside the environment you can construct a new path and do something with it. An example application of this environment is the arrow tip caching. Suppose you ask \ to use a specific arrow tip kind. When the arrow tip needs to be rendered for the first time, \ will ``cache''

**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Environment Specification  

**Description**: &#123;options&#125;&#125; This environment should only be used inside a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;|. It has the following effect: enumerate The environment contents are stroked/filled ``ignoring any outside transparency''. This means, all previous transparency settings are ignored (you can still set transparency inside the group, but never mind). This means that if in the environment contents you stroke a pixel three times in black, it is just black. Stroking it white afterwards yields a white pixel, and so on. When the gr

## 22. Environment: `{tikzfadingfrompicture`

**ID**: `0ff36c9a29bc`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Environment Specification  

**Description**: options&#125; This command works like a |&#123;tikzpicture&#125;|, only the picture is not shown, but instead a fading is defined based on this picture. To set the name of the picture, use the |name| option (which is normally used to set the name of a node). key&#123;/tikz/name=name&#125; Use this option with the |&#123;tikzfadingfrompicture&#125;| environment to set the name of the fading. You must provide this option. key The following shading is 2cm by 2cm and gets more and more transparent from left to right, but is 50\ &#123; cod

**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Environment Specification  

**Description**: &#123;animations spec&#125;&#123;options&#125;&#125; All \ commands should be given inside this environment, except for the || command. You cannot use graphics commands like the low-level command || outside this environment and doing so will result in chaos. For , commands like || are only defined inside this environment, so there is little chance that you will do something wrong here. When this environment is encountered, the options are parsed, see Section~section-graphic-options. All options given here will apply to

**ID**: `4cfacedb94b4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Environment Specification  

**Description**: mix-in specification&#125; The mix-in specification is applied to all colors inside the environment. At the beginning of the environment, the mix-in is applied to the current color, i.e., the color that was in effect before the environment started. A mix-in specification is a number between 0 and 100 followed by an exclamation mark and a color name. When a || command is encountered inside a mix-in environment, the number states what percentage of the desired color should be used. The rest is ``filled
