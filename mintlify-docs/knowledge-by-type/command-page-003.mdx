## 151. Command: `\legend\marg{list`

**ID**: `1de6f03ce919`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; You can use ||list to assign a complete legend. codeexample[code only] $d=2$,$d=3$,$d=4$,$d=5$,$d=6$ codeexample The argument of || is a list of entries, one for each plot. Two different delimiters are supported: enumerate There are comma-separated lists like codeexample[code only] $d=2$,$d=3$,$d=4$,$d=5$,$d=6$ codeexample These lists are processed using the || command and are quite powerful. The || command supports a dots notation to denote ranges like |1,2,...,5| or even |$x^1$,$x^...$,$x^d$

## 152. Command: `\ref\marg{label name`

**ID**: `56d340789afc`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Can be used to reference a labeled, single plot. See the example above. This will also work together with |hyperref| links and ||.Older versions of &#123; required the use of protect ref when used inside of captions or section headings. This is no longer necessary.&#125;

---

## 153. Command: `\pgfplotslegendfromname\marg{name`

**ID**: `dc13ba490913`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command poses an equivalent alternative for ||name: it has essentially the same effect, but it does not create links when used with the |hyperref| package.Since this manual uses colored links, the text in &#123; would usually be blue. Using avoids link text colors in the legend (this has been applied to the manual styles here).&#125;

---

## 154. Command: `\addlegendimage\marg{options`

**ID**: `14bf14545431`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Adds a further legend image for legend creation. Each || command appends its plot style options to a list, and || adds options to the very same list. Thus, the effect is as if you had provided ||options, but || bypasses all the logic usually associated with a plot. In other words: except for the legend, the state of the axis remains as if the command would not have been issued. Not even the current plot's index is advanced. codeexample[] tikzpicture semilogyaxis[ domain=0:4, ] &#123;x&#125;; $x$ &#123;x^2&#125;;

**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: toname&#125; Expects the current point in a set of keys, provided in the coordinate system fromname and replaces them by the same coordinates represented in toname. On input, the coordinates are stored in |/data point/x|, |/data point/y|, and |/data point/z| (the latter may be empty). The macro will test if there is a declared coordinate transformation from fromname to toname and invoke it. If there is none, it will attempt to convert to |cart| first and then from |cart| to toname. If that does not e

## 157. Command: `\pgfplotsdefinecstransform\marg{fromname`

**ID**: `0ad9f352433e`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: tonamecode&#125; Defines a new coordinate system transformation. The code is expected to get input and write output as described for ||. Implementing a new coordinate system immediately raises the question in which math mode the operations shall be applied. supports different so-called ``coordinate math systems'' for generic operations, and for each individual coordinate as well. These coordinate math systems can either use basic math arithmetics, the |fpu|, or perhaps there will come a Lua library.

**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Changes the names of all following figures. It is possible to change |figure name| during the document using |external/figure name|=&#123;name|&#125;|. A unique counter will be used for each different name, and each counter will start at $0$.These counters are stored into different &#123;macros. In other words: no register will be needed.&#125; The value of |prefix| will be applied after |figure name| has been evaluated. codeexample[code only] article tikz external document tikzpicture semilogyaxis &#123;exp(x)&#125;; semi

**ID**: `9825b47367a9`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is both used to define a new arrow tip kind and to to declare a so-called shorthand. We have a look at the case that a complete new arrow tip kind is created and then have a look how the command can be used to create shorthands. a Complete New Arrow Tip Kind. The config is a key--value list in which different keys are used to setup the to-be defined arrow. The following keys can be given: itemize |name||=|name or |name=|start name|-|end name This defines the name of the arrow tip.

---

## 187. Command: `\pgfarrowssetbackend\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `1c14f55cd083`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Works like the command for the tip end, only it sets the back end. In our example we would call codeexample[code only] -3cm codeexample Defaults to |0pt|.

---

## 188. Command: `\pgfarrowssetlineend\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `13c08435c5af`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the line end, so in the example we have |-1cm|. Default to |0pt|.

---

## 189. Command: `\pgfarrowssetvisualbackend\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `3602f19ef0e6`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the visual back end, |-2cm| in our example. Default to the value of the normal back end.

---

## 190. Command: `\pgfarrowssetvisualtipend\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `8d15f7325043`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the visual tip end. Default to the value of the normal tip end and, thus, we need not set it in our example.

---

## 191. Command: `\pgfarrowshullpoint\marg{x dimension`

**ID**: `524a0a0711be`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y dimension&#125; Adds a point to the convex hull of the arrow tip. As for the previous commands, no math parsing is done; instead \ says |@x=|x dimension and then |@y=|y dimension. Thus, both ``dimensions'' can contain code for advancing and thus modifying |@x| and |@y|. In our example we would write codeexample[code only] 1cm&#123;0pt&#125; -3cm&#123;2cm&#125; -3cm&#123;-2cm&#125; codeexample

---

## 192. Command: `\pgfarrowsupperhullpoint\marg{x dimension`

**ID**: `263437697762`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y dimension&#125; This command works like the previous command, only it normally adds two points to the convex hull: First, the point $(x dimension,y dimension)$ and, secondly, the point $(x dimension,-y dimension)$. However, the second point is only added if the arrow is not a harpoon. Thus, in our example we could simplify the convex hull to codeexample[code only] 1cm&#123;0pt&#125; -3cm&#123;2cm&#125; codeexample If the y dimension is zero or less, only one point, namely $(x dimension,y dimension)$, is added to the h

---

## 193. Command: `\pgfarrowssave\marg{macro`

**ID**: `942f7c129904`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; As explained earlier, the setup code needs to ``communicate'' with the drawing code via ``saved values''. This command get the name of a macro and will store the value this macro had internally. Then, each time drawing code is executed, the value of this macro will be restored.

---

## 194. Command: `\pgfarrowssavethe\marg{register`

**ID**: `12453b5f397f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Works like ||, only the parameter must be a register and ||register will be saved. Typically, you will write something like codeexample[code only] codeexample To ensure that inside the drawing code the the dimension registers || and || are setup with the values they had during the setup.

---

## 195. Command: `\pgfarrowsaddtooptions\marg{code`

**ID**: `cfad944ed0a6`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command should be called by keys with the prefix |/pgf/arrow keys| to add code to the arrow option cache. For our |depth| key example, we could use this key as follows: codeexample[code only] /pgf/arrow keys/depth/.code= &#123;&#123;&#123;#1&#125;&#125; codeexample Actually, this is still not optimal since the expensive || command is now called each time an arrow tip is used with the |depth| option set. The trick is to do the expensive operation only once and then store only very quick code in the arrow option ca

---

## 196. Command: `\pgfarrowsaddtolateoptions\marg{code`

**ID**: `8c4ae20db260`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command works like ||, only the code will be executed ``later'' than the code added by the normal version of the command. This is useful for keys that depend on the length of an arrow: Keys like |width'| want to define the arrow width as a multiple of the arrow length, but when the |width'| key is given, the length may not yet have been specified. By making the computation of the width a ``late'' option, we ensure that || will have been setup correctly.

---

## 197. Command: `\pgfarrowsaddtolengthscalelist\marg{dimension register`

**ID**: `91b246a907f2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Each time an arrow tip is used, the given dimension register will be multiplied by the |scale length| factor prior to the actual drawing. You call this command only once in the preamble somewhere.

---

## 198. Command: `\pgfarrowsaddtowidthscalelist\marg{dimension register`

**ID**: `560f52dd68a7`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Works like ||, only for width parameters.

---

## 199. Command: `\pgfarrowsthreeparameters\marg{line-width dependent size specification`

**ID**: `ecb86c834ad3`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is useful for parsing the values given to keys like |length| or |width| the expect a dimension followed optionally for some numbers. This command converts the line-width dependent size specification, which may consist of one, two, or three numbers, into a triple of three numbers in curly braces, which gets stored in the macro ||. Here is an example, where || is used in this example to show the value stored in a macro: codeexample[setup code,hidden] #1&#123; @gobble#1 &#125; codeexample code

---

## 200. Command: `\pgfarrowslinewidthdependent\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `1969c80b9bf5`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: line width factorouter factor&#125; This command takes three parameters and does the ``line width dependent computation'' described on page~length-arrow-key for the |length| key. The result is returned in |@x|. The idea is that you can setup line-width dependent keys like |length| or |width| using code like the following: codeexample[code only] /pgf/arrow keys/depth/.code=&#123; &#123;#1 @x &#125; codeexample
