**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: node optionsnode text&#125; A subgraph node is a node that ``surrounds'' the nodes of a subgraph. The special property of a subgraph node opposed to a normal node is that it is created only after the subgraph has been laid out. However, the difference to a collection like |hyper| is that the node is available immediately as a normal node in the sense that you can connect edges to it. What happens internally is that subgraph nodes get ``registered'' immediately both on the \ level and on the Lua level

**ID**: `e81866983da5`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: text&#125; This command is used to parse the text using the (previously defined) parser named parser name. The text is not contained in curly braces, rather it is all the text that follows. The end of the text is determined implicitly, namely when the final state of the parser has been reached. If you defined a final action for the parser using || it is executed now. The parser works as follows: At any moment, it is in a certain state, initially this state is called |initial|. Then, the first letter

**ID**: `e404398108aa`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: truefalse&#125; Remember that some of the optional argument types set special marks? With || you can test whether arg is such a mark. So if there was no optional argument for the argument types |o| and |d| the true branch will be executed, else the false branch. For the |t| type argument the true branch is executed if the token was encountered.

---

## 493. Command: `\pgfparserreinsert`

**ID**: `bf2ca3b6201a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: You can use this as the final macro in an action of || or ||. This has the effect that the contents of || will be parsed next.

---

## 496. Command: `\pgfparserletter`

**ID**: `30b9df9f7867`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This macro stores the letter to which || was let. So if you'd use |fooa| this macro would be defined with ||. This definition is done before any action code is executed. There are four special cases: If the next token is of category code 1, 2, 6, or 10, so with standard category codes the tokens |&#123;|, |&#125;|, |#|, and \ (a space), it would be treated differently. In those cases this macro expands to ||, ||, |##|, and \ for the categories 1, 2, 6, and 10, respectively.
