## 651. Command: `\pgfpagescurrentpagewillbelogicalpage\marg{number`

**ID**: `22c0e538c203`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; When the current \ page has been typeset, it will be become the given logical page number. This command ``interrupts'' the normal order of logical pages, that is, it behaves like the previous command and does not update the current logical page counter. codeexample[code only] two screens with optional second ... Text for main page. 2 Text that goes to second page Text for main page. codeexample

## 652. Command: `\usegdlibrary\marg{list of libraries`

**ID**: `6b38a634f7ae`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is used to load the special graph drawing libraries (the |gd| in the name of the command stands for ``graph drawing''). The list of libraries is a comma-separated list of library written in the Lua programming language (which is why a special command is needed). In detail, this command does the following. For each name in the list of libraries we do: enumerate Check whether Lua\ can call |require| on the library file |pgf.gd.|name|.library|. Lua's usual file search mechanism will

## 653. Command: `\pgfsetstrokeopacity\marg{value`

**ID**: `92b4e170bea6`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the opacity of stroking operations. The value should be a number between |0| and |1|, where |1| means ``fully opaque'' and |0| means ``fully transparent''. A value like |0.5| will cause paths to be stroked in a semitransparent way. codeexample[] pgfpicture 5mm red &#123;0cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125;&#123;10mm&#125; stroke black 0.5 &#123;1cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125;&#123;10mm&#125; stroke pgfpicture codeexample

## 654. Command: `\pgfsetfillopacity\marg{value`

**ID**: `26619cd7b6ef`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the opacity of filling operations. As for stroking, the value should be a number between |0| and~|1|. The ``filling transparency'' will also be used for text and images. codeexample[] tikzpicture 0.5 [red] (90:1cm) circle (11mm); [green] (210:1cm) circle (11mm); [blue] (-30:1cm) circle (11mm); tikzpicture codeexample

## 655. Command: `\pgfsetblendmode\marg{mode`

**ID**: `d852de44482c`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the blend mode to one of the values described in Section~section-blend-modes. As described there, blend modes are an advanced feature of pdf and not always rendered correctly. codeexample[] [transparency group] &#123; screen [red!90!black] ( 90:.6) circle (1); [green!80!black] (210:.6) circle (1); [blue!90!black] (330:.6) circle (1); &#125; codeexample

## 656. Command: `\pgfdeclarefading\marg{name`

**ID**: `bcbd4343a2ad`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: contents&#125; This command declares a fading named name for later use. The ``picture'' on which the fading is based is given by the contents. The contents are normally typeset in a \ box. The resulting box is then used as the ``picture''. In particular, inside the contents you must explicitly open a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;| environment if you wish to use \ commands. Let's start with an easy example. Our first fading picture is just some text: codeexample[] fading1&#123;white&#123;TikZ&#125;&#125; tikzpicture [black!20] (0,0) rec

---

## 657. Command: `\pgfsetfading\marg{name`

**ID**: `7bfff4e0041c`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: transformations&#125; This command sets the graphic state parameter ``fading'' to a previously defined fading name. This graphic state works like other graphic states, that is, is persists till the end of the current scope or until a different transparency setting is chosen. When the fading is installed, it will be centered on the origin with its natural size. Anything outside the fading picture's original bounding box will be transparent and, thus, the fading effectively clips against this bounding 

---

## 658. Command: `\pgfsetfadingforcurrentpath\marg{name`

**ID**: `8c232d7a89d3`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: transformations&#125; This command works like ||, but the fading is scaled and transformed according to the following rules: enumerate If the current path is empty, the command has the same effect as ||. Otherwise it is assumed that the fading has a size of 100bp times 100bp. The fading is resized and shifted (using appropriate transformations) such that the position $(25bp,25bp)$ lies at the lower-left corner of the current path and the position $(75bp,75bp)$ lies at the upper-right corner of the cu

---

## 659. Command: `\pgfsetfadingforcurrentpathstroked\marg{name`

**ID**: `f9308dc1789d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: transformations&#125; This command works like ||, only the current path is enlarged by the line width in both $x$- and $y$-direction. This is exactly the enlargement necessary to compensate for the fact that if the current path will be stroked, this much needs to be added around the path's bounding box to actually contain the path. codeexample[preamble=&#123;shading&#123;100bp&#125; &#123; color(0pt)=(transparent!0); color(25bp)=(transparent!0); color(75bp)=(transparent!100); color(100bp)=(transparent!100)&#125; fading&#123;shadi

## 660. Command: `\pgfsys@beginpicture`

**ID**: `b86551b80b0b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Called at the beginning of a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;|. This command should ``set up things''. Most drivers will need to implement this command.

---

## 661. Command: `\pgfsys@endpicture`

**ID**: `1e86242abeea`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Called at the end of a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;|. Most drivers will need to implement this command.

---

## 662. Command: `\pgfsys@typesetpicturebox\marg{box`

**ID**: `d495320f0569`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Called after a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;| has been typeset. The picture will have been put in box box. This command should insert the box into the normal text. The box box will still be a ``raw'' box that contains only the ||'s that make up the description of the picture. The job of this command is to resize and shift box according to the baseline shift and the size of the box. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

---

## 663. Command: `\pgfsys@beginpurepicture`

**ID**: `7131cc43e666`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This version of the |@beginpicture| picture command can be used for pictures that are guaranteed not to contain any escaped boxes (see below). In this case, a driver might provide a more compact version of the command. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

---

## 664. Command: `\pgfsys@endpurepicture`

**ID**: `ad9ad3c229a0`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Called at the end of a ``pure'' |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;|. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

---

## 665. Command: `\pgfsys@hbox\marg{box number`

**ID**: `d5851b60358f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Called to insert a (horizontal) TeX box inside a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;|. Most drivers will need to (re-)implement this command.

---

## 666. Command: `\pgfsys@hboxsynced\marg{box number`

**ID**: `85cc43f09625`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Called to insert a (horizontal) TeX box inside a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;|, but with the current coordinate transformation matrix synced with the canvas transformation matrix. This command should do the same as if you used || followed by |@hbox|. However, the default implementation of this command will use a ``TeX-translation'' for the translation part of the transformation matrix. This will ensure that hyperlinks ``survive'' at least translations. On the other hand, a driver may choose to revert to a si

---

## 667. Command: `\pgfsys@pictureboxsynced\marg{box number`

**ID**: `19378eb71d93`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Basically, this should do the same as doing a (scoped) low level sync followed by inserting the box box number directly into the output stream. However, the default implementation uses |@hboxsynced| in conjunction with |@beginpicture| to ensure that, if possible, hyperlinks survive in pdfs. Drivers that are sensitive to picture-in-picture scopes should replace this implementation by codeexample[code only] @beginscope#1@endscope codeexample

---

## 668. Command: `\pgfsys@beginscope`

**ID**: `9e981f240555`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Saves the current graphic state on a graphic state stack. All changes to the graphic state parameters mentioned for |@stroke| and |@fill| will be local to the current graphic state and the old values will be restored after |@endscope| is used. Warning: \ and PostScript differ with respect to the question of whether the current path is part of the graphic state or not. For this reason, you should never use this command unless the path is currently empty. For example, it might be a good idea to us

---

## 669. Command: `\pgfsys@endscope`

**ID**: `11dbe5dad64f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Restores the last saved graphic state. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 670. Command: `\pgfsys@moveto\marg{x`

**ID**: `cf724402c339`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y&#125; This command is used to start a path at a specific point $(x,y)$ or to move the current point of the current path to $(x,y)$ without drawing anything upon stroking (the current path is ``interrupted''). Both x and y are given as \ dimensions. It is the driver's job to transform these to the coordinate system of the backend. Typically, this means converting the \ dimension into a dimensionless multiple of $1&#123;72&#125;in$. The function |@sys@bp| helps with this conversion. Draw a line from $(10pt,10p

---

## 671. Command: `\pgfsys@lineto\marg{x`

**ID**: `f438efddef4c`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y&#125; Continue the current path to $(x,y)$ with a straight line. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 672. Command: `\pgfsys@curveto\marg{$x_1$`

**ID**: `a1ac5cb431c0`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: $y_1$$x_2$$y_2$$x_3$$y_3$&#125; Continue the current path to $(x_3,y_3)$ with a Bézier curve that has the two control points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$. Draw a good approximation of a quarter circle: codeexample[code only] @moveto&#123;10pt&#125;&#123;0pt&#125; @curveto&#123;10pt&#125;&#123;5.55pt&#125;&#123;5.55pt&#125;&#123;10pt&#125;&#123;0pt&#125;&#123;10pt&#125; @stroke codeexample This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 673. Command: `\pgfsys@rect\marg{x`

**ID**: `c7ba5ac6fd3e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: ywidthheight&#125; Append a rectangle to the current path whose lower left corner is at $(x,y)$ and whose width and height in big points are given by width and height. This command can be ``mapped back'' to |@moveto| and |@lineto| commands, but it is included since \ has a special, quick version of this command. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 674. Command: `\pgfsys@closepath`

**ID**: `642b9af3fa27`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Close the current path. This results in joining the current point of the path with the point specified by the last |@moveto| operation. Typically, this is preferable over using |@lineto| to the last point specified by a |@moveto|, since the line starting at this point and the line ending at this point will be smoothly joined by |@closepath|. Consider codeexample[code only] @moveto&#123;0pt&#125;&#123;0pt&#125; @lineto&#123;10bp&#125;&#123;10bp&#125; @lineto&#123;0bp&#125;&#123;10bp&#125; @closepath @stroke codeexample and codeexample[code only] @moveto&#123;0

## 675. Command: `\pgfsys@transformcm\marg{a`

**ID**: `4e154a2f9606`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: bcdef&#125; Perform a concatenation of the canvas transformation matrix with the matrix given by the values a to f, see the \ or PostScript manual for details. The values a to d are dimensionless factors, e and f are \ dimensions |@transformcm&#123;1&#125;&#123;0&#125;&#123;0&#125;&#123;1&#125;&#123;1cm&#125;&#123;1cm&#125;|. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 676. Command: `\pgfsys@transformshift\marg{x displacement`

**ID**: `31897d2d6274`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y displacement&#125; This command will change the origin of the canvas to $(x,y)$. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 677. Command: `\pgfsys@transformxyscale\marg{x scale`

**ID**: `3700eef7494d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y scale&#125; This command will scale the canvas (and everything that is drawn) by a factor of x scale in the $x$-direction and y scale in the $y$-direction. Note that this applies to everything, including lines. So a scaled line will have a different width and may even have a different width when going along the $x$-axis and when going along the $y$-axis, if the scaling is different in these directions. Usually, you do not want this. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemen

---

## 678. Command: `\pgfsys@viewboxmeet\marg{$x_1$`

**ID**: `eacefbe8264d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: $y_1$$x_2$$y_2$ $x'_1$$y'_1$$x'_2$$y'_2$ &#125; Starts a ``view box'' scope, which must be ended using |@endviewbox| later on (with matching scopes). The effect of this command is as follows: Consider the rectangles $R$ with lower left corner $(x_1,y_1)$ and upper right corner $(x_2,y_2)$ and $R'$ with corners $(x'_1,y'_1)$ and $(x'_2,y'_2)$. The command will install a canvas translation and uniform scaling such that $R'$ then has the same center as~$R$ and additionally, has maximum size such that it

---

## 679. Command: `\pgfsys@viewboxslice\marg{$x_1$`

**ID**: `c4df205f4068`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: $y_1$$x_2$$y_2$ $x'_1$$y'_1$$x'_2$$y'_2$ &#125; Works like the previous command, but now $R'$ has minimal size such that it encompasses all of $R$.

---

## 680. Command: `\pgfsys@endviewbox`

**ID**: `d78e22821573`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Ends a viewbox previously started using |@viewboxmeet| or the |...slice| variant.

---

## 681. Command: `\pgfsys@stroke`

**ID**: `6cb84be8affe`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Stroke the current path (as if it were drawn with a pen). A number of graphic state parameters influence this, which can be set using appropriate system commands described later. description [Line width] The ``thickness'' of the line. A width of 0 is the thinnest width renderable on the device. On a high-resolution printer this may become invisible and should be avoided. A good choice is 0.4pt, which is the default. [Stroke color] This special color is used for stroking. If it is not set, the cu

---

## 682. Command: `\pgfsys@closestroke`

**ID**: `75cfa3cd159b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command should have the same effect as first closing the path and then stroking it. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 683. Command: `\pgfsys@fill`

**ID**: `b8e398850853`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command fills the area surrounded by the current path. If the path has not yet been closed, it is closed prior to filling. The path itself is not stroked. For self-intersecting paths or paths consisting of multiple parts, the nonzero winding number rule is used to determine whether a point is inside or outside the path, except if |@eorule| holds -- in which case the even-odd rule should be used. (See the \ or PostScript manual for details.) The following graphic state parameters influence t

---

## 684. Command: `\pgfsys@fillstroke`

**ID**: `b4e23322a515`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: First, the path is filled, then the path is stroked. If the fill and stroke colors are the same (or if they are not specified and the current color is used), this yields almost the same as a |@fill|. However, due to the line thickness of the stroked path, the fill-stroked area will be slightly larger. In addition to stroking and filling the path, the path will also be used for clipping if |@clipnext| is used prior to this command. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 685. Command: `\pgfsys@discardpath`

**ID**: `d6ab1a2467d2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Normally, this command should ``throw away'' the current path. However, after |@clipnext| has been called, the current path should subsequently be used for clipping. See |@clipnext| for details. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 686. Command: `\pgfsys@clipnext`

**ID**: `a1331e630876`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command should be issued after a path has been constructed, but before it has been stroked and/or filled or discarded. When the command is used, the next stroking/filling/discarding command will first be executed normally. Then, afterwards, the just-used path will be used for subsequent clipping. If there has already been a clipping region, this region is intersected with the new clipping path (the clipping cannot get bigger). The nonzero winding number rule is used to determine whether a p

**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Sets the join to a bevel join. See |@stroke|. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 695. Command: `\pgfsys@setdash\marg{pattern`

**ID**: `9bcb244a6fef`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: phase&#125; Sets the dashing pattern. pattern should be a list of \ dimensions separated by commas. phase should be a single dimension. |@setdash&#123;3pt,3pt&#125;&#123;0pt&#125;| The list of values in pattern is used to determine the lengths of the ``on'' and ``off'' phases of the dashing. For example, if pattern is |3bp,4bp|, then the dashing pattern is ``3bp on followed by 4bp off, followed by 3bp on, followed by 4bp off, and so on''. A pattern of |.5pt,4pt,3pt,1.5pt| means ``.5pt on, 4pt off, 3pt on, 1.5pt off, .5p
