## 651. Command: `\pgfsys@begininvisible`

**ID**: `e7d7ac2370b2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Between this command and the closing |@endinvisible| all output should be suppressed. Nothing should be drawn at all, which includes all paths, images and shadings. However, no groups (neither \ groups nor graphic state groups) should be opened by this command. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

---

## 652. Command: `\pgfsys@endinvisible`

**ID**: `43634e629279`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Ends the invisibility section, unless invisibility blocks have been nested. In this case, only the ``last'' one restores visibility. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

## 653. Command: `\pgfsys@papersize\marg{width`

**ID**: `886c4420952d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: height&#125; Inserts the necessary ||s for the current driver into the output stream to ``locally'' change the page size. Whether such a ``local'' change is possible depends strongly on the driver. For instance, |dvips| will honor the first call to this command that is part of the shipped-out document and will ignore all other uses. In contrast, |pdftex| will use the current value of the paper size for each page and, additionally, setting the papersize is local to the current \ group.

---

## 654. Command: `\pgfsys@global@papersize\marg{width`

**ID**: `2e0d3fe060e8`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

**ID**: `68c88515825e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification

---

## 657. Command: `\pgfsys@markposition\marg{name`

**ID**: `68692af08271`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Marks a position on the page. This command should be given while normal typesetting is done such as in codeexample[code only] The value of $x$ is @markposition&#123;here&#125;important. codeexample It causes the position |here| to be saved when the page is shipped out.

---

## 658. Command: `\pgfsys@getposition\marg{name`

**ID**: `c46681bfda82`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macro&#125; This command retrieves a position that has been marked on an earlier run of \ on the current file. The macro must be a macro name such as ||. It will be redefined such that it is itemize either just || or a |...| command. itemize The first case will happen when the position has not been marked at all or when the file is typeset for the first time, when the coordinates are not yet available. In the second case, executing macro yields the position on the page that is to be interpreted as fo

---

## 660. Command: `\pgfpathsvg\marg{path`

**ID**: `20fa10f55fb4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command extends the current path by a path given in the svg-path-data syntax. This syntax is described in detail in Section~8.3 of the svg-specification, Version~1.1. In principle, the complete syntax is supported and the library just provides a parser and a mapping to basic layer commands. For instance, |M 0 10| is mapped to |&#123;0pt&#123;10pt&#125;&#125;|. There are, however, a few things to be aware of: itemize The computation underlying the arc commands |A| and |a| are not numerically stable, which may

**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Processes all options in exactly the same way as ||key--value-list, but a key filter is considered as soon as key identification is complete. The key filter tells || whether it should continue to apply the current option (return value is `true') or whether something different shall be done (filter returns `false'). There is exactly one key filter in effect, and it is installed by the |.install key filter| handler or by ||. If the key filter returns `false', a unique key filter handler gets con

## 683. Command: `\path\meta{specification`

**ID**: `df711edbc09a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: |;|&#125; This command is available only inside a |&#123;tikzpicture&#125;| environment. The specification is a long stream of path operations. Most of these path operations tell \ how the path is built. For example, when you write |--(0,0)|, you use a line-to operation and it means ``continue the path from wherever you are to the origin''. At any point where \ expects a path operation, you can also give some graphic options, which is a list of options in brackets, such as |[rounded corners]|. These options ca

## 684. Command: `\n\marg{number register`

**ID**: `54e9d0b1850a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; When this macro is used on the left-hand side of an |=|-sign in a let operation, it has no effect and is just there for readability. When the macro is used on the right-hand side of an |=|-sign or in the body of the let operation, then it expands to the value stored in the number register. This will either be a dimensionless number like |2.0| or a dimension like |5.6pt|. For instance, if we say |let 1=&#123;1pt+2pt&#125;, 2=&#123;1+2&#125; in ...|, then inside the |...| part the macro |1| will expand to |3pt| and

## 685. Command: `\p\marg{point register`

**ID**: `00bf42e3276d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; When this macro is used on the left-hand side of an |=|-sign in a let operation, it has no effect and is just there for readability. When the macro is used on the right-hand side of an |=|-sign or in the body of the let operation, then it expands to the $x$-part (measured in \ points) of the coordinate stored in the register, followed, by a comma, followed by the $y$-part. For instance, if we say |let 1=(1pt,1pt+2pt) in ...|, then inside the |...| part the macro |1| will expand to exactly the 

---

## 686. Command: `\x\marg{point register`

**ID**: `a389ceac4b3a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This macro expands just to the $x$-part of the point register. If we say as above, as we did above, |let 1=(1pt,1pt+2pt) in ...|, then inside the |...| part the macro |1| expands to |1pt|.

Then, the path construction is resumed. codeexample[] tikzpicture =1cm (0pt,) =2cm -- (0pt,); tikzpicture codeexample

---

## 689. Command: `\pgfextra \meta{code`

**ID**: `83fbe3b0808e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: `\&#125; This is an alternative syntax for the || command. If the code following || does not start with a brace, the code is executed until || is encountered. What actually happens is that when || is not followed by a brace, this completely shuts down the \ parser and || is a normal macro that restarts the parser. codeexample[] tikzpicture =1cm (0pt,) =2cm -- (0pt,); tikzpicture codeexample

## 690. Command: `\tikzfading\oarg{options`

**ID**: `39a27e88c786`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is used to define a fading similarly to the way a shading is defined. In the options you should enumerate use the |name=|name option to set a name for the fading, use the |shading| option to set the name of the shading that you wish to use, extra options for setting the colors of the shading (typically you will set them to the color |transparent!|percentage). enumerate Then, a new fading named name will be created based on the shading. codeexample[preamble=&#123;fadings,patterns&#125;] [nam

**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: initial statestates&#125; This command declares a new decoration called name. The states argument contains a description of the decoration automaton's states and the transitions between them. The initial state is the state in which the automaton starts. When the automaton is later applied to an input path, it keeps track of a certain position on the input path. This current point will ``travel along the path'', each time being moved along by a certain distance. This will also work if the path is not
