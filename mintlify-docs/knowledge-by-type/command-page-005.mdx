## 278. Command: `\addlegendentryexpanded\oarg{options`

**ID**: `525d94510584`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification

## 279. Command: `\legend\marg{list`

**ID**: `1de6f03ce919`  
**Package**: pgfplots

**ID**: `dc13ba490913`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command poses an equivalent alternative for ||name: it has essentially the same effect, but it does not create links when used with the |hyperref| package.Since this manual uses colored links, the text in &#123; would usually be blue. Using avoids link text colors in the legend (this has been applied to the manual styles here).&#125;

## 282. Command: `\addlegendimage\marg{options`

**ID**: `14bf14545431`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Adds a further legend image for legend creation. Each || command appends its plot style options to a list, and || adds options to the very same list. Thus, the effect is as if you had provided ||options, but || bypasses all the logic usually associated with a plot. In other words: except for the legend, the state of the axis remains as if the command would not have been issued. Not even the current plot's index is advanced. codeexample[] tikzpicture semilogyaxis[ domain=0:4, ] &#123;x&#125;; $x$ &#123;x^2&#125;;

The macro will test if there is a declared coordinate transformation from fromname to toname and invoke it. If there is none, it will attempt to convert to |cart| first and then from |cart| to toname. If that does not e

## 285. Command: `\pgfplotsdefinecstransform\marg{fromname`

**ID**: `0ad9f352433e`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification

## 288. Command: `\tikzsetfigurename\marg{name`

**ID**: `74c3f12bdf8f`  
**Package**: pgfplots  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Changes the names of all following figures. It is possible to change |figure name| during the document using |external/figure name|=&#123;name|&#125;|. A unique counter will be used for each different name, and each counter will start at $0$.These counters are stored into different &#123;macros. In other words: no register will be needed.&#125; The value of |prefix| will be applied after |figure name| has been evaluated. codeexample[code only] article tikz external document tikzpicture semilogyaxis &#123;exp(x)&#125;; semi
