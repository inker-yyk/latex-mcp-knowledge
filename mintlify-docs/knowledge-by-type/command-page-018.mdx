## 914. Command: `\pgfkeyssetvalue\marg{full key`

**ID**: `1a6a103dc01b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: token text&#125; Stores the token text in the full key. The full key may not be a partial key, so no default-path-adding is done. The token text can be arbitrary tokens and may even contain things like |#| or unbalanced -ifs. codeexample[] /my family/my key&#123;Hello, world!&#125; /my family/my key codeexample The setting of a key is always local to the current \ group.

**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macro&#125; Performs a || statement so the full key points to the contents of macro. codeexample[] , world! /my family/my key&#123;&#125; /my family/my key codeexample You should never let a key be equal to ||. Such a key may or may not be indistinguishable from an undefined key.

---

## 917. Command: `\pgfkeysgetvalue\marg{full key`

**ID**: `ea0d7a6d0e33`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macro&#125; Retrieves the tokens stored in the full key and lets macro be equal to these tokens. If the key has not been set, the macro will be equal to ||. codeexample[] /my family/my key&#123;Hello, world!&#125; /my family/my key&#123;&#125; codeexample

---

## 918. Command: `\pgfkeysvalueof\marg{full key`

**ID**: `879ce9148474`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Inserts the value stored in full key at the current position into the text. It expands to an alias of the primitive || if the key is undefined. codeexample[] /my family/my key&#123;Hello, world!&#125; /my family/my key codeexample Note: It is an error to assign to the result of the expansion of ||, not only semantically but in recent versions of \ also logically. To set the value of a key always use the appropriate interfaces, e.g.\ ||.

---

## 919. Command: `\pgfkeysifdefined\marg{full key`

**ID**: `c145a702c4ef`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: ifelse&#125; Checks whether this key was previously set using either || or ||. If so, the code in if is executed, otherwise the code in else. codeexample[] /my family/my key&#123;Hello, world!&#125; /my family/my key&#123;yes&#125;&#123;no&#125; codeexample

---

## 920. Command: `\pgfkeysifassignable\marg{full key`

**ID**: `d69c036ff2a0`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: ifelse&#125; Checks whether this key was previously set using either ||, ||, ||, or one of ||'s relatives. If so, the code in if is executed, otherwise the code in else. codeexample[] /my family/my keyA&#123;#1&#125; /my family/my keyB&#123;Hello, world!&#125; /my family/my keyA&#123;yes&#125;&#123;no&#125; /my family/my keyB&#123;yes&#125;&#123;no&#125; codeexample

---

## 921. Command: `\pgfkeys\marg{key list`

**ID**: `64cbb537f78b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; The key list should be a list of key--value pairs, separated by commas. A key--value pair can have the following two forms: key|=|value or just key. Any spaces around the key or around the value are removed. It is permissible to surround both the key or the value in curly braces, which are also removed. Especially putting the value in curly braces needs to be done quite often, namely whenever the value contains an equal-sign or a comma. The key--value pairs in the list are handled in the order

---

## 922. Command: `\pgfqkeys\marg{default path`

**ID**: `058378a0b288`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: key list&#125; This command has the same effect as ||&#123;default path|/.cd,|key list|&#125;|, it is only marginally quicker. This command should not be used in user code, but rather in commands like || or || that get called very often.

---

## 923. Command: `\pgfkeysalso\marg{key list`

**ID**: `524182c3e1a4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command has exactly the same effect as ||, only the default path is not modified before or after the keys are being set. This command is mainly intended to be called by the code that is being processed for a key.

---

## 924. Command: `\pgfqkeysalso\marg{default path`

**ID**: `e6b8cc7d6baf`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: key list&#125; This command has the same effect as ||&#123;default path|/.cd,|key list|&#125;|, it is only quicker. Changing the default path inside a || is dangerous, so use with care. A rather safe place to call this command is at the beginning of a \ group.

---

## 925. Command: `\pgfkeysdef\marg{key`

**ID**: `f53a4f3162b2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command temporarily defines a -macro with the argument list |#1| and then lets key|/.@cmd| be equal to this macro. The net effect of all this is that you have then set up code for the key key so that when you write ||&#123;key|=|value|&#125;|, then the code is executed with all occurrences of |#1| in code being replaced by value. (This behavior is quite similar to the |@key| command of |keyval| and |xkeyval|). codeexample[] /my key&#123;#1, #1.&#125; /my key=hello codeexample

---

## 926. Command: `\pgfkeysedef\marg{key`

**ID**: `f751a2b8f7f6`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command works like ||, but it uses || rather than || when defining the key macro. If you do not know the difference between the two, then you will not need this command; and if you know the difference, then you will know when you need this command.

---

## 927. Command: `\pgfkeysdefnargs\marg{key`

**ID**: `b4a031c35386`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: argument countcode&#125; This command works like ||, but it allows you to provide an arbitrary argument count between $0$ and $9$ (inclusive). codeexample[preamble=&#123;shortvrb \|&#125;] /my key&#123;2&#125;&#123;#1#2&#125; /my key= &#123;hello &#123;world&#125;&#125; || is `', || is `'. codeexample The resulting key will expect exactly argument count arguments.

**ID**: `e0be94f4715b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification

---

## 929. Command: `\pgfkeysdefargs\marg{key`

**ID**: `599a5881a801`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: argument patterncode&#125; This command works like ||, but it allows you to provide an arbitrary argument pattern rather than just a number of arguments. codeexample[preamble=&#123;shortvrb \|&#125;] /my key&#123;#1+#2&#125;&#123;#1#2&#125; /my key=hello+world || is `', || is `'. codeexample Note that || is better when it comes to simple argument countsWhen the resulting keys are used, the &#123;defnargs variant allows spaces between arguments whereas the defargs variant does not; it considers the spaces as part of the argument.&#125;.

---

## 930. Command: `\pgfkeysedefargs\marg{key`

**ID**: `98f5bc0555e4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: argument patterncode&#125; The || version of ||.

---

## 931. Command: `\value\marg{variable`

**ID**: `c91e6555abb3`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This expands to the current value of the key |/data point/|variable.

---

## 932. Command: `\pgfdata\opt{\oarg{options`

**ID**: `530b1a8c0c92`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: inline data&#125;&#125; This command is used to feed data to the visualization pipeline. This command can only be used when a data visualization object has been properly setup, see Section~section-dv-main-setup. Basic options. The || command may be followed by options, which are executed with the path |/pgf/data/|. Depending on these options, the options may either be followed by inline data or, alternatively, no inline data is present and the data is read from an external source. The first important opti

## 933. Command: `\pgfdeclaredataformat\marg{format name`

**ID**: `18e90364c9ca`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: catcode codestartup codeline arguments\ codeempty line codeend code &#125; This command defines a new data format called format name, which can subsequently be used in the || command. (The 's |data| maps directly to ||, so the following applies to \ as well.) As explained in the description of the || command, when data is being parsed that is formatted according to format name, the following happens: enumerate The catcode code is executed. This code should just contain catcode changes. The catcode co

## 934. Command: `\pgfnode\marg{shape`

**ID**: `91deb51594d2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: anchorlabel textnamepath usage command&#125; This command creates a new node. The shape of the node must have been declared previously using ||. The shape is shifted such that the anchor is at the origin. In order to place the shape somewhere else, use the coordinate transformation prior to calling this command. The name is a name for later reference. If no name is given, nothing will be ``saved'' for the node, it will just be drawn. The path usage command is executed for the background and the foreg

---

## 935. Command: `\pgfmultipartnode\marg{shape`

**ID**: `31e9df2cea08`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: anchornamepath usage command&#125; This command is the more general (and less user-friendly) version of the || command. While the || command can only be used for shapes that have a single part (which is the case for most shapes), this command can also be used with multi-part nodes. When this command is called, for each node part of the node you must have set up one -box. Suppose the shape has two parts: The |text| part and the |lower| part. Then, prior to calling ||, you must have set up the boxes ||

---

## 936. Command: `\pgfcoordinate\marg{name`

**ID**: `b151ff8f0895`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: coordinate&#125; This command creates a node of shape |coordinate| at the given coordinate. Exactly the same effect can be achieved using first a shift of the coordinate system to coordinate, followed by creating a node of shape |coordinate| named name. However, this command is easier and more natural to use and, more importantly, it is much faster.

---

## 937. Command: `\pgfnodealias\marg{new name`

**ID**: `9d7ad2a52876`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: existing node&#125; This command does not actually create a new node. Rather, it allows you to subsequently access the node existing node using the name new name.

---

## 938. Command: `\pgfnoderename\marg{new name`

**ID**: `e854813fc2a1`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: existing node&#125; This command renames an existing node.

---

## 939. Command: `\pgfpositionnodelater\marg{macro name`

**ID**: `56a6037bf697`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is not a replacement for ||. Rather, when this command is used in a scope, all subsequent node creations in this scope will be affected in the following way: When a node is created, it is not inserted into the current picture. Instead, it is stored in the box ||. Furthermore, the node is not relevant for the picture's bounding box, but a bounding box for the node is computed and stored in the macros || to ||. Then, the macro name is called with the following macros set up: command

---

## 940. Command: `\pgfpositionnodelatername`

**ID**: `5604f1331452`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: The name of the just-created-node. This name will be the originally ``desired'' name of the box plus the fixed prefix |not yet positionedPGFINTERNAL|. The idea is to ensure that the original name is not inadvertently used before the node is actually positioned. When || is called, it will change the name to the original name.

---

## 941. Command: `\pgfpositionnodelaterminx`

**ID**: `7b5a1c67f6de`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: The minimal $x$-position of a bounding box of the node. This bounding box refers to the node when it is positioned with the anchor at the origin. It is guaranteed, that this macro will contain a dimension in the format number|pt|.

## 945. Command: `\pgfpositionnodelaterpath`

**ID**: `d8fa0cf11ee2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This macro stores the path of the background of the node. See Section~section-soft-paths for an overview of how these paths are encode.

---

## 946. Command: `\pgfpositionnodenow\marg{coordinate`

**ID**: `2097828dfb69`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is used to position a node that has previously been created using the command ||. When || is called, the macros and boxes mentioned in the description of || must be set to the value they had when the macro name was called. Provided this is the case, this command will insert the box into the current picture, shifted by coordinate. Then, the late code (see below) is called. Subsequently, you can refer to the node with its original name as if it had just been created. codeexample[] =

---

## 947. Command: `\pgfnodepostsetupcode\marg{node name`

**ID**: `1b1bc769462b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; When you call this macro inside a scope for which the || has been called, the code will be stored internally. Later, when the node named node name is actually positioned using ||, the code will be executed. When this macro is called multiple times with the same node name, the code accumulates. However, When || is called, the code stored for the node is cleared. The main purpose of this mechanism is to allow \ to store so-called ``late options'' with a node that will be positioned only late

## 948. Command: `\pgfpointanchor\marg{node`

**ID**: `78ec38e00332`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: anchor&#125; This command is another ``point command'' like the commands described in Section~section-points. It returns the coordinate of the given anchor in the given node. The command can be used in commands like ||. codeexample[] pgfpicture 30 rectangle&#123;center&#125;&#123;Hello World!&#125;&#123;x&#125;&#123;stroke&#125; &#123;x&#123;north&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;south&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;east&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;west&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;north east&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; fill pgfpicture codeexample In the above example, you may have noticed something curious: The rotation transformation is still in f

## 949. Command: `\pgfpointshapeborder\marg{node`

**ID**: `0ae3ec3acc9a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: point&#125; This command returns the point on the border of the shape that lies on a straight line from the center of the node to point. For complex shapes it is not guaranteed that this point will actually lie on the border, it may be on the border of a ``simplified'' version of the shape. codeexample[] pgfpicture pgfscope 30 rectangle&#123;center&#125;&#123;Hello World!&#125;&#123;x&#125;&#123;stroke&#125; pgfscope &#123;x&#123;2cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;2cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;-1cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;-1cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; fill pgfpicture codeexample Remark: If the given poi
