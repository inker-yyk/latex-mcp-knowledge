## 901. Command: `\pgfpointborderrectangle\marg{direction point`

**ID**: `cf5576a1dc50`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: corner&#125; This command returns a point that lies on the intersection of a line starting at the origin and going towards the point direction point and a rectangle whose center is in the origin and whose upper right corner is at corner. The direction point should have length ``about 1pt'', but it will be normalized automatically. Nevertheless, the ``nearer'' the length is to 1pt, the less rounding errors. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (2,1.5); &#123;-1cm&#123;-1.25cm&#125;&#125;&#123;1cm&#123;1.25cm&#125;&#125; stroke

## 903. Command: `\pgfpointintersectionoflines\marg{$p$`

**ID**: `e664413d1673`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: $q$$s$$t$&#125; This command returns the intersection of a line going through $p$ and $q$ and a line going through $s$ and $t$. If the lines do not intersection, an arithmetic overflow will occur. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (2,2); (.5,0) -- (2,2); (1,2) -- (2,0); &#123;&#123;.5&#123;0&#125;&#125;&#123;2&#123;2&#125;&#125; &#123;1&#123;2&#125;&#125;&#123;2&#123;0&#125;&#125;&#125; &#123;2pt&#125; stroke tikzpicture codeexample

## 904. Command: `\pgfpointintersectionofcircles\marg{$p_1$`

**ID**: `0ed833df1b36`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: $p_2$$r_1$$r_2$solution&#125; This command returns the intersection of the two circles centered at $p_1$ and $p_2$ with radii $r_1$ and $r_2$. If solution is |1|, the first intersection is returned, otherwise the second one is returned. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (2,2); (0.5,0) circle (1); (1.5,1) circle (.8); &#123;&#123;.5&#123;0&#125;&#125;&#123;1.5&#123;1&#125;&#125; &#123;1cm&#125;&#123;0.8cm&#125;&#123;1&#125;&#125; &#123;2pt&#125; stroke tikzpicture codeexample

## 905. Command: `\pgfintersectionofpaths\marg{path 1`

**ID**: `f9b9818c7246`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: path 2&#125; This command finds the intersection points on the paths path 1 and path 2. The number of intersection points (``solutions'') that are found will be stored, and each point can be accessed afterward. The code for path 1 and path 2 is executed within a group and so can contain transformations (which will be in addition to any existing transformations). The code should not use the path in any way, unless the path is saved first and restored afterward. will regard solutions as ``a bit special

---

## 906. Command: `\pgfpointintersectionsolution\marg{number`

**ID**: `8225b1ef3105`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; After using the || command, this command will return the point for solution number or the origin if this solution was not found. By default, the intersections are simply returned in the order that the intersection algorithm finds them. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily a ``helpful'' ordering. However the following two commands can be used to order the solutions more helpfully.

---

## 907. Command: `\pgfintersectionsortbyfirstpath`

**ID**: `4f014fbe554a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Using this command will mean the solutions will be sorted along path 1.

---

## 908. Command: `\pgfintersectionsortbysecondpath`

**ID**: `1a2d0579446a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification

## 909. Command: `\pgfextractx\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `bd2f37120e09`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: point&#125; Sets the -dimension to the $x$-coordinate of the point. codeexample[code only] &#123;2cm&#123;4pt&#125;&#125; codeexample

---

## 910. Command: `\pgfextracty\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `9a8ace4d9f08`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: point&#125; Like ||, except for the $y$-coordinate.

---

## 911. Command: `\pgfgetlastxy\marg{macro for $x$`

**ID**: `a996c91505f6`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macro for $y$&#125; Stores the most recently used $(x,y)$ coordinates into two macros. codeexample[] 2cm&#123;4cm&#125; &#123;&#125; Macro $x$ is `' and macro $y$ is `'. codeexample Since $(x,y)$ coordinates are usually assigned globally, it is safe to use this command after path operations.

---

## 912. Command: `\pgf@process\marg{code`

**ID**: `c568f9555a85`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Executes the code in a scope and then makes |@x| and |@y| global.

---

## 913. Command: `\pgfdeclarepattern\marg{config`

**ID**: `4f7c7efa4570`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is used to declare a new pattern. In contrast to the normal patterns and in the spirit of |arrows.meta| this command takes a list of keys and values to define the pattern. The following keys are available: key&#123;/pgf/patterns/name=name&#125; The name of the pattern by which it can be used later on. key key&#123;/pgf/patterns/type=type (default uncolored)&#125; The type of the pattern maps to what was called ``form only'' and ``inherently colored'' in the language of the normal patterns. The availa

---

## 914. Command: `\tikzdeclarepattern\marg{config`

**ID**: `aea1b5c6c438`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; A pattern declared with || can only execute \ code. This command extends the functionality to also allow \ code. All the same keys of || are valid, but some of them have been overloaded to give a more natural \ syntax. key&#123;/tikz/patterns/bottom left=point&#125; Instead of a \ name point, this key takes a \ point, e.g.\ |(-.1,-.1)|. key key&#123;/tikz/patterns/top right=point&#125; Instead of a \ name point, this key takes a \ point, e.g.\ |(3.1,3.1)|. key key&#123;/tikz/patterns/tile size=point&#125; Instead of a \ na

---

## 915. Command: `\foreach| |\meta{variables`

**ID**: `2ee61135107b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: | |&#123;[options&#123;]&#125;&#125;| in |list commands&#125; The syntax of this command is a bit complicated, so let us go through it step-by-step. In the easiest case, variables is a single -command like || or ||. (If you want to have some fun, you can also use active characters. If you do not know what active characters are, you are blessed.) Still in the easiest case, options will be omitted. The keys for customizing this command will be discussed below. Again, in the easiest case, list is either a comma-separated l

---

## 916. Command: `\breakforeach`

**ID**: `71f962277919`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: If this command is given inside a || command, no further executions of the commands will occur. However, the current execution of the commands is continued normally, so it is probably best to use this command only at the end of a || command. codeexample[] tikzpicture in &#123;1,...,4&#125; in &#123;1,...,4&#125; &#123; [red!50] (,) ellipse (3pt and 6pt); &lt; &#125; tikzpicture codeexample

---

## 917. Command: `\pgfooclass\opt{|(|\meta{list of superclasses`

**ID**: `767db3cc7fac`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: |)|&#125;class namebody&#125; This command defines a class named class name. The name of the class can contain spaces and most other characters, but no periods. So, valid class names are |MyClass| or |my class| or |Class_C++_emulation??1|. The list of superclasses is optional just like the parenthesis around it. The body is actually just executed, so any normal -code is permissible here. However, while the body is being executed, the macros || and || are set up so that they can be used to define methods a

---

## 918. Command: `\pgfoonew\opt{\meta{object handle or attribute`

**ID**: `ac9acb7653eb`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: |=|&#125;|new |class name|(|constructor arguments|)|&#125; Causes a new object to be created. The class of the object will be class name, which must previously have been declared using ||. Once the object has been created, the constructor method of the object will be called with the parameter list set to constructor arguments. The resulting object is stored internally and its lifetime will end exactly at the end of the current scope. Here is an example in which three stamp objects are created. codeexample

---

## 919. Command: `\pgfoogc`

**ID**: `a9abf67cec01`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command causes the ``garbage collector'' to be invoked. The job of this garbage collector is to free the global -macros that are used by ``dead'' objects (objects whose life-time has ended). This macro is called automatically after every scope in which an object has been created, so you normally do not need to call this macro yourself.

---

## 920. Command: `\method \meta{method name`

**ID**: `6b1fc70cd79a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: |(|parameter list|)|method body&#125; This macro, which is only defined inside a class definition, defines a new method named method name. Just like class names, method names can contain spaces and other characters, so method names like |put_stamp_here| or |put stamp here| are both legal. Three method names are special: First, a method having either the same name as the class or having the name |init| is called the constructor of the class. There are (currently) no destructors; objects simply become 

---

## 921. Command: `\pgfoothis`

**ID**: `ff00536e9e20`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This object handle is well-defined only when a method is being executed. There, it is then set to point to the object for which the method is being called, which allows you to call another method for the same object. codeexample[code only] stamp&#123; stamp() &#123;&#125; apply(#1,#2) &#123; .shift origin(#1,#2) [rotate=20,font=] &#123;Passed&#125;; &#125; shift origin(#1,#2) &#123; xshift=#1,yshift=#2 &#125; &#125; codeexample

---

## 922. Command: `\pgfoosuper|(|\meta{class`

**ID**: `f9a25664591a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: ,object handle|).|method name|(|arguments|)|&#125; This macro gives you finer control over which method gets invoked in case of multiple inheritance. This macro calls method name of the object specified by object handle, but which implementation of the method is called is determined as follows: it will be the implementation in the first class (in the method resolution order) after class that defines method name.

---

## 923. Command: `\attribute \meta{attribute name`

**ID**: `8f48fe8c4454`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: |=|&#123;initial value&#125;|;|&#125; This command can only be given inside the body of an || command. It declares the attribute named attribute name. This name, like method or class names, can be quite arbitrary, but should not contain periods. Valid names are |an_attribute?| or |my attribute|. You can optionally specify an initial value for the attribute; if none is given, the empty string is used automatically. The initial value is the value that the attribute will have just after the object has been create

---

## 924. Command: `\pgfooset\marg{attribute`

**ID**: `9fe5e9a7f772`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: value&#125; Sets the attribute of the current object to value. codeexample[code only] set rotation (#1) &#123; rotation angle&#123;#1&#125; &#125; codeexample

---

## 925. Command: `\pgfooeset\marg{attribute`

**ID**: `8110b5e42416`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

---

## 930. Command: `\pgfooget\marg{attribute`

**ID**: `0f62391fda4b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macro&#125; Reads the current value of attribute and stores the result in macro. codeexample[code only] ... get rotation (#1) &#123; rotation angle&#123;#1&#125; &#125; ... .get rotation() ``'' is now ``20'' (or whatever). codeexample

---

## 931. Command: `\pgfooobj\marg{id`

**ID**: `5ced27ce7373`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Provided that id is the id of an existing object (an object whose life-time has not expired), calling this command yields a handle to this object. The handle can then be used to call methods: codeexample[code only] =new stamp() .get id() .apply(1,1) .apply(1,1) codeexample

---

## 932. Command: `\pgfsysanimate\marg{attribute`

**ID**: `af89e58a47f8`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125;

---

## 933. Command: `\pgfsys@animate\marg{attribute`

**ID**: `e636081d8086`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; The system layer animation subsystem follows the following philosophy: An animation always concerns an attribute of a graphic object. A timeline specifies how the attribute changes its value over time. Finally, a set of keys configures the animation as a whole like whether the timeline repeats or a event that triggers the start of the animation. The four parts of an animation, namely the attribute, the graphic object, the timeline, and the keys, are specified in different ways: enumerate You c

---

## 934. Command: `\pgfsysanimsnapshot\marg{time`

**ID**: `2d7a14f05a71`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Use this command in a scope prior to calling any other commands documented in this section concerning the configuration of animations. In this case, all uses of || inside the \ scope no longer insert an animation into the output file. Instead, a ``snapshot'' is inserted of what the animation ``would like at time time''. For instance, if an animation inserts a movement of an object by 4cm over a time of 2s and you take a snapshot with $time = 2 s$, you get a picture in which the object is moved

---

## 935. Command: `\pgfsysanimsnapshotafter\marg{time`

**ID**: `148b7388526e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Works like the previous command, only the ``moment'' that time refers to is conceptually $time + $: When timeline specifies several values for time, this command will select the last value at time, while || will select the first value at time. Similarly, when a timeline ends at time, || will select the last value of the timeline while || will not apply the animation any more.

---

## 936. Command: `\pgfsysanimkeytipmarkers\marg{start marker`

**ID**: `7d77507f7618`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

---

## 937. Command: `\pgfsys@animation@tip@markers\marg{start marker`

**ID**: `6a2caec46207`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: end marker&#125; This command specifies that during a path animation the two markers provided as parameters should be added (and rotated and moved along with the path) at the start and end. The start marker must either be empty (in which case no marker is added at the start) or it must be a macro storing a value returned by the command |@marker@declare|. In this case, the marker declared symbol will be added to the start during the animation. The same situation applies to the end of the path. As poin

## 939. Command: `\pgfsys@animation@canvas@transform\marg{pre`

**ID**: `d7a3b7bc6578`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: post&#125; In order to animate the canvas, you specify that, for instance, the canvas should be shifted over, say, one second by 2cm from left to right. In order to specify this, you specify that an additional shift should be added to the canvas transformation matrix that starts out as $(0,0)$ and ends at $(2\,cm,0)$. However, it is not immediately clear what ``to the right'' or $(2\,cm,0)$ actually means: ``Right'' relative to the paper? ``Right'' relative to the coordinate system at the point when
