## 1056. Command: `\pgfpositionnodenow\marg{coordinate`

**ID**: `2097828dfb69`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command is used to position a node that has previously been created using the command ||. When || is called, the macros and boxes mentioned in the description of || must be set to the value they had when the macro name was called. Provided this is the case, this command will insert the box into the current picture, shifted by coordinate. Then, the late code (see below) is called. Subsequently, you can refer to the node with its original name as if it had just been created. codeexample[] =

## 1057. Command: `\pgfnodepostsetupcode\marg{node name`

**ID**: `1b1bc769462b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; When you call this macro inside a scope for which the || has been called, the code will be stored internally. Later, when the node named node name is actually positioned using ||, the code will be executed. When this macro is called multiple times with the same node name, the code accumulates. However, When || is called, the code stored for the node is cleared. The main purpose of this mechanism is to allow \ to store so-called ``late options'' with a node that will be positioned only late

## 1058. Command: `\pgfpointanchor\marg{node`

**ID**: `78ec38e00332`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: anchor&#125; This command is another ``point command'' like the commands described in Section~section-points. It returns the coordinate of the given anchor in the given node. The command can be used in commands like ||. codeexample[] pgfpicture 30 rectangle&#123;center&#125;&#123;Hello World!&#125;&#123;x&#125;&#123;stroke&#125; &#123;x&#123;north&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;south&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;east&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;west&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;north east&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; fill pgfpicture codeexample In the above example, you may have noticed something curious: The rotation transformation is still in f

## 1059. Command: `\pgfpointshapeborder\marg{node`

**ID**: `0ae3ec3acc9a`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: point&#125; This command returns the point on the border of the shape that lies on a straight line from the center of the node to point. For complex shapes it is not guaranteed that this point will actually lie on the border, it may be on the border of a ``simplified'' version of the shape. codeexample[] pgfpicture pgfscope 30 rectangle&#123;center&#125;&#123;Hello World!&#125;&#123;x&#125;&#123;stroke&#125; pgfscope &#123;x&#123;2cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;2cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;x&#123;-1cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; &#123;-1cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125;&#123;2pt&#125; fill pgfpicture codeexample Remark: If the given poi

## 1060. Command: `\pgfdeclareshape\marg{shape name`

**ID**: `da4ab0c6d3bc`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: shape specification&#125; This command declares a new shape named shape name. The shape name can later be used in commands like ||. The shape specification is some \ code containing calls to special commands that are only defined inside the shape specification (similarly to commands like || that are only available inside the |&#123;tikzpicture&#125;| environment). Here is the code of the |coordinate| shape: codeexample[code only] coordinate &#123; @x=.5 @y=.5 @y by -.5 center&#123;&#125; &#125; codeexample The special commands ar

## 1061. Command: `\savedanchor\marg{command`

**ID**: `cc9b062a70e6`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command declares a saved anchor. The argument command should be a \ macro name like ||. The code will be executed each time || (or ||) is called to create a node of the shape shape name. When the code is executed, the -boxes of the node parts will contain the text labels of the node. Possibly, these box are void. For example, if there is just a |text| part, the node || will be set up when the code is executed. The code can use the width, height, and depth of the box(es) to compute the

---

## 1062. Command: `\saveddimen\marg{command`

**ID**: `a974b53eeb58`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command is similar to ||, only instead of setting command to ||$x$|&#123;|$y$|&#125;|, the command is set just to (the value of) $x$. In the |simple rectangle| shape we might use a saved dimension to store the depth of the shape box. codeexample[code only] &#123; @x= &#125; codeexample

---

## 1063. Command: `\savedmacro\marg{command`

**ID**: `20877c4f57a7`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command is similar to ||, only at some point in code, command should be defined appropriately, (this could be a value, or some text). In the |regular polygon| shape, a saved macro is used to store the number of sides of the polygon. codeexample[code only] &#123;&#125; codeexample

---

## 1064. Command: `\anchor\marg{name`

**ID**: `1cb579ab0801`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command declares an anchor named name. Unlike for saved anchors, the code will not be executed each time a node is declared. Rather, the code is only executed when the anchor is specifically requested; either for anchoring the node during its creation or as a position in the shape referenced later on. The name is a quite arbitrary string that is not ``passed down'' to the system level. Thus, names like |south| or |1| or |::| would all be fine. A saved anchor is not automatically also 

---

## 1065. Command: `\deferredanchor\marg{name`

**ID**: `de2db4ffbffd`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command declares an anchor named name. It works like ||. However, unlike for anchors declared by ||, name will not be expanded during the shape declaration (i.e.\ not during ||). Rather, the name is expanded when the node is actually used (with || or more likely with ||). This may be useful if the anchor name is context dependent (depending, for example, on the value of a key). codeexample[code only] simple shape&#123; &#123; &#125; center&#123;&#125; &#123; @x=1cm @y=0cm&#125; anchor &#123;&#125;&#125; tikzpicture [simple shape] (Te

---

## 1066. Command: `\anchorborder\marg{code`

**ID**: `77d9eed40ac3`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; A border anchor is an anchor point on the border of the shape. What exactly is considered as the ``border'' of the shape depends on the shape. When the user requests a point on the border of the shape using the || command, the code will be executed to discern this point. When the execution of the code starts, the dimensions |@x| and |@y| will have been set to a location $p$ in the shape's coordinate system, and relative to the anchor |center|. Note that || will produce an error if the shape do

---

## 1067. Command: `\backgroundpath\marg{code`

**ID**: `1813648c583b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command specifies the path that ``makes up'' the background of the shape. Note that the shape cannot prescribe what is going to happen with the path: It might be drawn, shaded, filled, or even thrown away. If you want to specify that something should ``always'' happen when this shape is drawn (for example, if the shape is a stop-sign, we always want it to be filled with a red color), you can use commands like ||, explained below. When the code is executed, all saved anchors will be in eff

---

## 1068. Command: `\foregroundpath\marg{code`

**ID**: `48d8c761d9dc`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command works like ||, only it is invoked after the text labels have been drawn. This means that this path can possibly obscure (part of) the text labels.

---

## 1069. Command: `\behindbackgroundpath\marg{code`

**ID**: `a9842a9f4116`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Unlike the previous two commands, code should not only construct a path, it should also use this path in whatever way is appropriate. For example, the code might fill some area with a uniform color. Whatever the code does, it does it first. This means that any drawing done by code will be even behind the background path. Note that the code is protected with a |&#123;pgfscope&#125;|.

---

## 1070. Command: `\beforebackgroundpath\marg{code`

**ID**: `877af75bdd93`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

---

## 1073. Command: `\inheritsavedanchors|[from=|\marg{another shape name`

**ID**: `7bc778ff7276`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: |]|&#125; This command allows you to inherit the code for saved anchors from another shape name. The idea is that if you wish to create a new shape that is just a small modification of a another shape, you can recycle the code used for another shape name. The effect of this command is the same as if you had called || and || for each saved anchor or saved dimension declared in another shape name. Thus, it is not possible to ``selectively'' inherit only some saved anchors, you always have to inherit al

---

In this case, the arrow keys will be set for all arrow tips in the current scope, see Section~section-arrow-scopes.

---

## 1099. Command: `\pgfsetshortenstart\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `eae315166d80`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command will shortened the start of every stroked path by the given dimension. This shortening is done in addition to automatic shortening done by a start arrow, but it can be used even if no start arrow is given. It is usually better to use the |sep| key with arrow tips. This command is useful if you wish arrows or lines to ``stop shortly before'' a given point. codeexample[preamble=&#123;arrows.meta&#125;] pgfpicture &#123;5mm&#125; stroke Latex- 4pt &#123;5mm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125; &#123;2cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125; stroke pgfpicture codeexample
