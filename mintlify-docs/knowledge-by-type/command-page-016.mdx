---

## 835. Command: `\tikz\opt{\meta{animations spec`

**ID**: `f247d875e552`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125;&#123;options&#125;path commands&#125; This command places the path commands inside a |&#123;tikzpicture&#125;| environment. The path commands may contain paragraphs and fragile material (like verbatim text). If there is only one path command, it need not be surrounded by curly braces, if there are several, you need to add them (this is similar to the || statement and also to the rules in programming languages like Java or C concerning the placement of curly braces). | (0,0) rectangle (2ex,1ex);| yields (0,0) rectangle

---

**ID**: `b2f391fd0e4f`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command will process the options using the || command, documented in detail in Section~section-keys, with the default path set to |/tikz|. Under normal circumstances, the options will be lists of comma-separated pairs of the form key|=|value, but more fancy things can happen when you use the power of the |pgfkeys| mechanism, see Section~section-keys once more. When a pair key|=|value is processed, the following happens: enumerate If the key is a full key (starts with a slash) it is handle

## 838. Command: `\pgfmathparse\marg{expression`

**ID**: `5db05afa1272`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This macro parses expression and returns the result without units in the macro ||. |2pt+3.5pt| will set || to the text |5.5|. In the following, the special properties of this command are explained. The exact syntax of mathematical expressions is explained in Sections pgfmath-operators and~pgfmath-functions. itemize The result stored in the macro || is a decimal without units. This is true regardless of whether the expression contains any unit specification. All numbers with units are converted

---

## 839. Command: `\pgfmathqparse\marg{expression`

**ID**: `0c665ccdc61e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This macro is similar to ||: it parses expression and returns the result in the macro ||. It differs in two respects. Firstly, || does not parse functions, scientific notation, the prefixes for binary octal, or hexadecimal numbers, nor does it accept the special use of |"|, |?| or |:| characters. Secondly, numbers in expression must specify a unit (except in such instances as |0.5@x|), which greatly simplifies the problem of parsing real numbers. As a result of these restrictions || is about t

---

## 840. Command: `\pgfmathpostparse`

**ID**: `6e7b5a6aa29b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: At the end of the parse this command is executed, allowing some custom action to be performed on the result of the parse. When this command is executed, the macro || will hold the result of the parse (as always, without units). The result of the custom action should be used to redefine || appropriately. By default, this command is equivalent to ||. This differs from previous versions, where, if the parsed expression contained no units, the result of the parse was scaled according to the value in

---

## 841. Command: `\pgfmathsetlength\marg{register`

**ID**: `b89178b9b3c3`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: expression&#125; Basically, this command sets the length of the register to the value specified by expression. However, there is some fine print: First, in case expression starts with a |+|, a simple \ assignment is done. In particular, register can be a glue register and expression be something like |+1pt plus 1fil| and the register will be assigned the expected value. Second, when the expression does not start with |+|, it is first parsed using ||, resulting in a (dimensionless) value ||. Now, if t

## 842. Command: `\pgfmathaddtolength\marg{register`

**ID**: `bf29532813d9`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification

---

## 843. Command: `\pgfmathsetcount\marg{count register`

**ID**: `1426cea8a94d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: expression&#125; Sets the value of the count register, to the truncated value specified by expression.

---

## 844. Command: `\pgfmathaddtocount\marg{count register`

**ID**: `bfa0d0715dc4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: expression&#125; Adds the truncated value of expression to the count register.

---

## 845. Command: `\pgfmathsetcounter\marg{counter`

**ID**: `867abaecea8e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: expression&#125; Sets the value of the counter to the truncated value specified by expression.

---

## 846. Command: `\pgfmathaddtocounter\marg{counter`

**ID**: `5ed2283ac258`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: expression&#125; Adds the truncated value of expression to counter.

---

## 847. Command: `\pgfmathsetmacro\marg{macro`

**ID**: `112a6acb7ad0`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: expression&#125; Defines macro as the value of expression. The result is a decimal without units.

---

## 848. Command: `\pgfmathsetlengthmacro\marg{macro`

**ID**: `5d8e679742e3`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification

**ID**: `07066b966577`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: expression&#125; Defines macro as the truncated value of expression.

---

## 850. Command: `\ifpgfmathunitsdeclared`

**ID**: `d900d357b572`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: After a call of || this if will be true exactly if some unit was encountered in the expression. It is always set globally in each call. Note that any ``mentioning'' of a unit inside an expression will set this -if to true. In particular, even an expressionlike |2pt/1pt|, which arguably should be considered ``scalar'' or ``unit-free'' will still have this -if set to true. However, see the |scalar| function for a way to change this.
