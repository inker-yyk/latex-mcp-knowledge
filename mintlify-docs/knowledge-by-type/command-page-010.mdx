**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: angle&#125; This command must be used inside a |&#123;pgfpicture&#125;| environment. The effect is a bit complex, so let us go over it step by step. First, \ will set up a local scope. Second, it uses the current path to clip everything inside this scope. However, the current path is once more available after the scope, so it can be used, for example, to stroke it. Now, the shading name should be a shading whose width and height are 100\,bp, that is, 100 big points. \ has a look at the bounding box of the curr

**ID**: `49556493c936`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Adds a dependency for the next picture which is about to be externalized. If the command is invoked within a picture environment, it adds a dependency for the surrounding picture. Dependencies are written into target file|.dep| in the format target file|.: |file name. The effect is that if file name changes, the external graphics associated with the picture shall be remade. This command uses the contents of to check for graphics. If you encounter difficulties with image extensions, consider re

**ID**: `08dac8fef488`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Allows to disable the complete externalization. While |export next| will still collect the contents of picture environments, this command uninstalls the hooks for the |external| library completely. Thus, nested picture environments or environments where |tikzpicture| is not directly reachable won't produce compilation failures -- although it is not possible to externalize them automatically. The externalization remains disabled until the end of the next \ group (or environment) or until the next

---

## 532. Command: `\tikzifexternalizingnext\marg{true code`

**ID**: `07a37a5f9a92`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: statements\&#125;&#125; This command process a series of statements which can represent assignments, function definitions, conditional evaluation, and iterations. It provides, in effect, a miniature mathematical language to perform basic mathematical operations. Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that every statement should end with a semi-colon.
