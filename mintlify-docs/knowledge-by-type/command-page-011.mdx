## 559. Command: `\pgftransformreset`

**ID**: `e63f2c1d8ef2`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Resets the coordinate transformation matrix to the identity matrix. Thus, once this command is given no transformations are applied till the end of the scope. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 30 (0,0) -- (2,1) -- (1,0); [red] (0,0) -- (2,1) -- (1,0); tikzpicture codeexample

---

## 560. Command: `\pgftransformresetnontranslations`

**ID**: `985641710168`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command sets the $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ part of the coordinate transformation matrix to $a=1$, $b=0$, $c=0$, and $d=1$. However, the current shifting of the matrix is not modified. The effect of this command is that any rotation/scaling/slanting is undone in the current \ group, but the origin is not ``moved back''. This command is mostly useful directly before a || command to ensure that the text is not scaled or rotated. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 2 30 1cm &#123;r

---

## 561. Command: `\pgftransforminvert`

**ID**: `f91f83e7aae9`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: Replaces the coordinate transformation matrix by a coordinate transformation matrix that ``exactly undoes the original transformation''. For example, if the original transformation was ``scale by 2 and then shift right by 1cm'' the new one is ``shift left by 1cm and then scale by $1/2$''. This command will produce an error if the determinant of the matrix is too small, that is, if the matrix is near-singular. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 30 (0,0) -- (2,1) -- (1,0); [r

---

## 562. Command: `\pgfgettransform\marg{macro`

**ID**: `1d582c713ffb`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command will (locally) define macro to a representation of the current coordinate transformation matrix. This matrix can later on be reinstalled using ||.

---

## 563. Command: `\pgfsettransform\marg{macro`

**ID**: `471f53419c81`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Reinstalls a coordinate transformation matrix that was previously saved using ||.

---

## 564. Command: `\pgfgettransformentries\marg{macro for a`

**ID**: `06c438c0c789`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macro for bmacro for cmacro for dmacro for shift xmacro for shift y &#125; This command is similar to || except that it stores the current coordinate transformation matrix in a set of six macros. The matrix can later on be reinstalled using ||. Furthermore, all these macros (or just a few of them) can be used as arguments for ||.

---

## 565. Command: `\pgfsettransformentries\marg{a`

**ID**: `a3a1d58e974d`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: bcdshiftxshifty&#125; Reinstalls a coordinate transformation matrix that was previously saved using the storage command ||. This command can also be used to replace any previously existing coordinate transformation matrix (it is thus equivalent to || followed by ||).

---

## 566. Command: `\pgfpointtransformed\marg{point`

**ID**: `30a7922e1f05`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Applies current transformation matrix to point $(x,y)$ and returns a transformed point $(ax+cy+s,bx+dy+t)$. Normally, this is done automatically by commands like || or ||, but sometimes you may wish to access a transformed point yourself.

---

## 567. Command: `\pgftransformationadjustments`

**ID**: `f96c712a2052`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command computes ``adjustments'' for the current transformation matrix so that even when you install a transformation matrix that scales everything by a certain factor, you can still draw something of ``an absolute size''. Suppose for instance that you install a transformation matrix that scales everything by a factor of 4 and you now wish to draw a horizontal line of length 1cm. Then, if you do not reset the transformation matrix, you can draw a line of logical length 2.5mm, which will the

## 568. Command: `\pgfverticaltransformationadjustment`

**ID**: `50f771da557c`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: $1/\|transform(0,1)\|_2$.

---

## 569. Command: `\pgflowlevelsynccm`

**ID**: `2e38a7017ceb`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command concatenates the canvas transformation matrix with the current coordinate transformation matrix. Afterward, the coordinate transformation matrix is reset. The effect of this command is to ``synchronize'' the coordinate transformation matrix and the canvas transformation matrix. All transformations that were previously applied by the coordinate transformations matrix are now applied by the canvas transformation matrix. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 1pt 5 (0

---

## 570. Command: `\pgflowlevel\marg{transformation code`

**ID**: `322dd8a01c92`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command concatenates the canvas transformation matrix with the coordinate transformation specified by transformation code. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 1pt &#123;5&#125; (0,0) -- (0.4,.2); tikzpicture codeexample

---

## 571. Command: `\pgflowlevelobj\marg{transformation code`

**ID**: `fe75ae76002e`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: code&#125; This command creates a local |&#123;pgfscope&#125;|. Inside this scope, || is first called with the argument transformation code, then the code is inserted. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 1pt &#123;5&#125; &#123; (0,0) -- (0.4,.2);&#125; &#123;-1cm&#125;&#123; (0,0) -- (0.4,.2);&#125; tikzpicture codeexample

## 572. Command: `\pgftransformnonlinear\marg{transformation code`

**ID**: `7e9d4234e20b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command adds the transformation code to the list of non-linear transformations currently in force. Thus, similar to linear coordinate transformations, each additional call to this function adds another transformation to the current \ scope and the effect ends at the end of the current scope. In practice, however, you typically will not have more than one active nonlinear transformation. The job of the transformation code is to map a point~$p$ given in the registers |@x| and |@y| to a new 

---

## 573. Command: `\pgfpointtransformednonlinear\marg{point`

**ID**: `632f9a4aa963`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Works like ||, but also applies the current nonlinear transformation; that is, it first applies the current linear transformation and then the current nonlinear transformations. Note that, just like ||, you normally do not call this function directly since it is called internally by the path drawing commands.

---

## 574. Command: `\pgfsettransformnonlinearflatness\marg{dimension`

**ID**: `91b5dd4c5fa8`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: (initially 5pt)&#125; Whenever in a to-be-drawn curve the $L^$-distance (maximum of the distances in $x$- and $y$-directions) between the start of a curve and its first control point or between the first and second control points or between the second control point and the end is more than distance, the curve gets split in the middle (more precisely, at time $t= 0.5$) and we draw the two parts individually (for them, splitting may occur again, if the curve is still too long). codeexample[preamble=&#123;no

---

## 575. Command: `\pgfapproximatenonlineartransformation`

**ID**: `a38d7c799204`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command will do two things: enumerate It clears the nonlinear transformations for the rest of the current \ scope, so only linear transformations apply. However, before removing the nonlinear transformations, the linear transformation matrix is modified so that it mimics the effect the nonlinear transformation had at the origin. That is, after you call this command, drawing something near the origin will look almost the same as if you had not called it. enumerate codeexample[preamble=&#123;nonli

---

## 576. Command: `\pgfapproximatenonlineartranslation`

**ID**: `1006b4d46cae`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This command works like the normal approximation command, but it will only approximate how the origin gets translated, it will not approximate the rotation, skewing, or scaling that is involved. This is useful for drawing text at the right position, but without ``mutilating'' the text. codeexample[preamble=&#123;nonlineartransformations&#125;] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); (0pt,0mm) grid [xstep=10pt, ystep=5mm] (90pt, 20mm); scope[shift=&#123;(45pt,20mm)&#125;] [red] (-10pt,-10pt) -- (10pt,10pt); [red]

---

## 577. Command: `\pgfsetcurvilinearbeziercurve\marg{start`

**ID**: `ca72293e6ad7`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: first supportsecond supportend&#125; Prior to using any other command from this library, you first call this function to ``install'' a Bézier curve to which the commands will refer. This curve will be local to the current \ scope and you can install only one curve at a time. The main job of this command is to store the passed points internally and to build a lookup table for distance-to-time conversions, see the next command. codeexample[code only] &#123;&#125; &#123;1cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;2cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;3cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125; codeexample

---

## 578. Command: `\pgfcurvilineardistancetotime\marg{distance`

**ID**: `25305537ccd9`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; This command does a ``distance-to-time-conversion'': It tries to compute a time $t$, returned in |@x|, that corresponds to travelling distance along the curve that has last been installed using the command ||. The distance-to-time-conversion uses the precomputations done by that command. Note that several compromises had to be made between speed and accuracy: itemize The conversion will be best near the start of the curve. The more ``degenerate'' the curve, the worse the results. itemize

---

## 579. Command: `\pgfpointcurvilinearbezierorthogonal\marg{distance`

**ID**: `842e21571d64`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: offset&#125; This command computes the following point: Consider the curve last installed using the command ||. We travel along this curve by distance, arriving at a point $p$. Then, we turn by $90^$ and travel by offset units ``always from the curve'', arriving at a point $q$. This point $q$ will now be returned in |@x| and |@y|; furthermore, the transformed local coordinate system at point $q$ will also be returned |@xa| and the other registers, see || for details. codeexample[ preamble=&#123;nonlineart

---

## 580. Command: `\pgfpointcurvilinearbezierpolar\marg{x`

**ID**: `b9daf4af7f11`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: y&#125; This command is similar to the previous version, but the transformation is different: The idea is that a line form $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$ gets transformed to the curve from the start of the curve to a point at distance $x$ along the curve. This is identical to what the ``orthogonal'' transformation above also does. The difference is that a line from $(0,0)$ to $(0,y)$ gets still transformed to an initial segment of the curve of a length of $y$, but now rotated by $90^$. In general, the point $p =

---

## 581. Command: `\pgfprofilenew\marg{name`

**ID**: `8b876c8e3dfd`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Defines a new profiler entry named name. This updates a set of internal registers used to track the profiler entry. The name can be arbitrary, it doesn't need to be related to any \ macro. The actual job of counting seconds is accomplished using ||name followed eventually by the command ||name. It doesn't hurt if || is called multiple times with the same name.

---

## 582. Command: `\pgfprofilenewforcommand\oarg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `482b096cfe55`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macroarguments&#125; Defines a new profiler entry which will measure the time spent in macro. This calls || and replaces the current definition of macro with a new one. If profiler entry name has been provided, this defines the argument for ||. It is allowed to use the same name for multiple commands; in this case, they are treated as if it where the same command. If the optional argument is not used, the profiler entry will be called `' (macro without backslash) where || is predefined to be |&lt;CS&gt;|. 

---

## 583. Command: `\pgfprofilenewforcommandpattern\oarg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `c8329b2093f7`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: macroargument patterninvocation pattern&#125; A variant of || which can be used with arbitrary argument patterns. Example: codeexample[code only] #1#2#3&#123; ... &#125; &#123;#1#2#3&#125;&#123;&#123;#1&#125;#2#3&#125; codeexample Note that || is a special case of ||: codeexample[code only] #1#2&#123; ... &#125; 2 &#123;#1#2&#125;&#123;&#123;#1&#125;&#123;#2&#125;&#125; codeexample Thus, argument pattern is a copy-paste from the definition of your command. The invocation pattern is used by the |profiler| library to invoke the original command, so it is closely related to argument pattern,

## 584. Command: `\pgfprofileshowinvocationsfor\marg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `716c3c94c7e7`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Enables verbose output for every invocation of profiler entry name. This is only available for profiler entries for commands (those created by || for example). It will also show all given arguments.

---

## 585. Command: `\pgfprofileshowinvocationsexpandedfor\marg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `cda0d206f0cb`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; A variant of || which will expand all arguments for profiler entry name before showing them. The invocation as such is not affected by this expansion. This expansion (with ||) might yield unrecoverable errors for some commands. Handle with care.

---

## 586. Command: `\pgfprofilenewforenvironment\oarg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `07e6c3339e9b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: environment name&#125; Defines a new profiler entry which measures time spent in the environment environment name. This calls || and handles the begin/end of the environment automatically. The argument for || is profiler entry name, or, if this optional argument is not used, it is ` name' where || is predefined as |&lt;ENV&gt;|. Again, it is permitted to use the same profiler entry name multiple times to merge different commands into one output section.

---

## 587. Command: `\pgfprofilestart\marg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `0a3d36afbff8`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Starts (or resumes) timing of profiler entry name. The argument must have been declared in the preamble using ||. Nested calls of || with the same argument will be ignored. The invocation of this command doesn't change the environment: it doesn't introduce any \ groups nor does it modify the token list.

---

## 588. Command: `\pgfprofileend\marg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `84b850ab22ae`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Stops (or interrupts) timing of profiler entry name. This command finishes a preceding call to ||.

---

## 589. Command: `\pgfprofilepostprocess`

**ID**: `b1485c70c34b`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: For , this command is installed automatically in |document|. It stops all running timings, evaluates them and returns the result into the logfile. Furthermore, it generates a text table called |.profiler.|YYYY|-|MM|-|DD|_|HH|h_|MM|m.dat| with the same information. Note that the |profiler| library predefines two profiler entries, namely |main job| which counts time from the beginning of the document until || and |preamble| which counts time from the beginning of the document until |document|.

---

## 590. Command: `\pgfprofilesetrel\marg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `5acd9c473ab4`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: (initially main job)&#125; Sets the profiler entry whose total time will be used to compute all other relative times. Thus, profiler entry name will use $100\ total time per definition, all other relative times are relative to this one.

## 591. Command: `\pgfprofileifisrunning\marg{profiler entry name`

**ID**: `9202b6e51bdf`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: true codefalse code&#125; Invokes true code if profiler entry name is currently running and false code otherwise.

## 592. Command: `\pgfplothandlercurveto`

**ID**: `f369813f70ca`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: This handler will issue a || command for each point of the plot, except possibly for the first. As for the line-to handler, what happens with the first point can be specified using || or ||. Obviously, the || command needs, in addition to the points on the path, some control points. These are generated automatically using a somewhat ``dumb'' algorithm: Suppose you have three points $x$, $y$, and $z$ on the curve such that $y$ is between $x$ and $z$: codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node &#123;x

## 593. Command: `\pgfsetplottension\marg{value`

**ID**: `4b291303c9bb`  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  
**Type**: Command Specification  

**Description**: &#125; Sets the factor used by the curve plot handlers to determine the distance of the control points from the points they control. The higher the curvature of the curve points, the higher this value should be. A value of $1$ will cause four points at quarter positions of a circle to be connected using a circle. The default is $0.5$. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node &#123;x&#125; (1,1) node &#123;y&#125; (2,.5) node &#123;z&#125;; 0.75 &#123;0cm&#123;0cm&#125;&#125; &#123;1cm&#123;1cm&#125;&#125; &#123;2cm&#123;0.5cm&#125;&#125; stroke tikzpicture codeexample
