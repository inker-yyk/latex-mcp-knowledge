## Search Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Use precise terms like "3d surface plot" rather than just "3d"
2. **Use Categories**: Filter by category to narrow results
3. **Try Variations**: If you don't find what you need, try synonyms
4. **Check Examples**: Look at complete examples for context
5. **Use Commands**: Search by LaTeX command names for quick reference
