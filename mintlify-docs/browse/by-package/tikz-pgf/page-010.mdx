## 2021. Command

**ID**: `b6ab30c92b5f`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Sets the opacity of all operations, treating stroking and filling as a transparency group. Some drivers support this operations, others do not and set the fill and stroke individually. This difference can only be seen when a path is stroked and filled at the same time: When the drawing and fill opacities are set individually, the effect of filling and drawing a path at the same time is the same as first filling the path and then drawing it. On the other, if the opacity is set using this comman

} This takes a \ box and converts it into a transparency group. This means that any transparency settings apply to the box as a whole. For instance, if a box contains two overlapping black circles and you draw the box and, thus, the two circles normally with 50\ overlap will be darker than the rest. By comparison, if the circles are part of a transparency group, the overlap will get the same color as the rest.

## 2030. Command

**ID**: `1138e4512156`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by driver files other than |pgfsys-dvips.def|. The macro is called in quote || and || quote of the basic layer, where it invokes the current path for clipping the shading just before installing it as an opacity mask for fading. The default implementation is actually a non-operation, but with |dvips| it is used to clip the fading as described.


---

## 2031. Command

**ID**: `257a583c3cff`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf

## 2033. Command

**ID**: `6155d66f24dc`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} ``Uses'' an id previously created using |@new@id|. This causes the next graphic object to get the id (not the current one). Once used, the id-type-pair becomes invalid and will not be attached to any other graphics objects. It is, however, not an error to try this. If id is empty, no id-type-pair is attached to the next object.

## 2038. Command

**ID**: `78fe1ca7fa33`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

Starts a (graphics) scope whose sole purpose is to assign it an id-type-pair so that it can be referenced later. Note that this command does not always produce a graphics scope: If no id is currently in use or if the id-type-pair has already been used, a graphic scope may or may not be created as defined by the driver (but always a \ scope). This allows drivers to minimize the number of graphic scopes created. When an id scope is created, any code that has been ``attached'' to it using |@attach@

### Description

} This command extends the current path by a path given in the svg-path-data syntax. This syntax is described in detail in Section~8.3 of the svg-specification, Version~1.1. In principle, the complete syntax is supported and the library just provides a parser and a mapping to basic layer commands. For instance, |M 0 10| is mapped to |{0pt{10pt}}|. There are, however, a few things to be aware of: itemize The computation underlying the arc commands |A| and |a| are not numerically stable, which may
