## 1625. Command

**ID**: `8b876c8e3dfd`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Defines a new profiler entry named name. This updates a set of internal registers used to track the profiler entry. The name can be arbitrary, it doesn't need to be related to any \ macro. The actual job of counting seconds is accomplished using ||name followed eventually by the command ||name. It doesn't hurt if || is called multiple times with the same name.


---

## 1626. Command

**ID**: `482b096cfe55`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

macroarguments} Defines a new profiler entry which will measure the time spent in macro. This calls || and replaces the current definition of macro with a new one. If profiler entry name has been provided, this defines the argument for ||. It is allowed to use the same name for multiple commands; in this case, they are treated as if it where the same command. If the optional argument is not used, the profiler entry will be called `' (macro without backslash) where || is predefined to be |<CS>|. 


---

## 1627. Command

**ID**: `c8329b2093f7`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

macroargument patterninvocation pattern} A variant of || which can be used with arbitrary argument patterns. Example: codeexample[code only] #1#2#3{ ... } {#1#2#3}{{#1}#2#3} codeexample Note that || is a special case of ||: codeexample[code only] #1#2{ ... } 2 {#1#2}{{#1}{#2}} codeexample Thus, argument pattern is a copy-paste from the definition of your command. The invocation pattern is used by the |profiler| library to invoke the original command, so it is closely related to argument pattern,


---

## 1628. Command

**ID**: `716c3c94c7e7`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Enables verbose output for every invocation of profiler entry name. This is only available for profiler entries for commands (those created by || for example). It will also show all given arguments.


---

## 1629. Command

**ID**: `cda0d206f0cb`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} A variant of || which will expand all arguments for profiler entry name before showing them. The invocation as such is not affected by this expansion. This expansion (with ||) might yield unrecoverable errors for some commands. Handle with care.


---

## 1630. Command

**ID**: `07e6c3339e9b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

environment name} Defines a new profiler entry which measures time spent in the environment environment name. This calls || and handles the begin/end of the environment automatically. The argument for || is profiler entry name, or, if this optional argument is not used, it is ` name' where || is predefined as |<ENV>|. Again, it is permitted to use the same profiler entry name multiple times to merge different commands into one output section.


---

## 1631. Command

**ID**: `0a3d36afbff8`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Starts (or resumes) timing of profiler entry name. The argument must have been declared in the preamble using ||. Nested calls of || with the same argument will be ignored. The invocation of this command doesn't change the environment: it doesn't introduce any \ groups nor does it modify the token list.


---

## 1632. Command

**ID**: `84b850ab22ae`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Stops (or interrupts) timing of profiler entry name. This command finishes a preceding call to ||.


---

## 1633. Command

**ID**: `b1485c70c34b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

For , this command is installed automatically in |document|. It stops all running timings, evaluates them and returns the result into the logfile. Furthermore, it generates a text table called |.profiler.|YYYY|-|MM|-|DD|_|HH|h_|MM|m.dat| with the same information. Note that the |profiler| library predefines two profiler entries, namely |main job| which counts time from the beginning of the document until || and |preamble| which counts time from the beginning of the document until |document|.


---

## 1634. Command

**ID**: `5acd9c473ab4`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

(initially main job)} Sets the profiler entry whose total time will be used to compute all other relative times. Thus, profiler entry name will use $100\ total time per definition, all other relative times are relative to this one.


---

## 1635. Command

**ID**: `9202b6e51bdf`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

true codefalse code} Invokes true code if profiler entry name is currently running and false code otherwise.

## 1652. Command

**ID**: `f369813f70ca`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This handler will issue a || command for each point of the plot, except possibly for the first. As for the line-to handler, what happens with the first point can be specified using || or ||. Obviously, the || command needs, in addition to the points on the path, some control points. These are generated automatically using a somewhat ``dumb'' algorithm: Suppose you have three points $x$, $y$, and $z$ on the curve such that $y$ is between $x$ and $z$: codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x

The higher the curvature of the curve points, the higher this value should be. A value of $1$ will cause four points at quarter positions of a circle to be connected using a circle. The default is $0.5$. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x} (1,1) node {y} (2,.5) node {z}; 0.75 {0cm{0cm}} {1cm{1cm}} {2cm{0.5cm}} stroke tikzpicture codeexample

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command will execute the mark code for some points of the plot, but each time the coordinate transformation matrix will be set up such that the origin is at the position of the point to be plotted. This way, if the mark code draws a little circle around the origin, little circles will be drawn at some point of the plot. By default, a mark is drawn at all points of the plot. However, two parameters $r$ and $p$ influence this. First, only every $r$th mark is drawn. Second, the first mark dr

### Description

} This command sets the \ dimension || to dimension. This dimension is a ``recommendation'' for plot mark code at which size the plot mark should be drawn; plot mark code may choose to ignore this dimension altogether. For circles, dimension should be the radius, for other shapes it should be about half the width/height. The predefined plot marks all take this dimension into account. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x} (1,1) node {y} (2,.5) node {z}; 1ex {*} {0cm{0cm}} {1cm{1cm}} {2c

## 1793. Command

**ID**: `cfb07b8c1eed`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command will store the current soft path in macro name.


---

## 1794. Command

**ID**: `8a0cc738e518`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command will set the current soft path to be the path stored in macro name. This macro should store a path that has previously been extracted using the |@getcurrentpath| command and has possibly been modified subsequently.


---

## 1795. Command

**ID**: `bd49c5520404`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This command will turn the current soft path in a ``hard'' path. To do so, it iterates over the soft path and calls an appropriate |@xxxx| command for each element of the path. Note that the current soft path is not changed by this command. Thus, in order to start a new soft path after the old one has been invoked and is no longer needed, you need to set the current soft path to be empty. This may seem strange, but it is often useful to immediately use the last soft path again.


---

## 1796. Command

**ID**: `7eeb6dacadf0`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description
