### Description

The box box will still be a ``raw'' box that contains only the ||'s that make up the description of the picture. The job of this command is to resize and shift box according to the baseline shift and the size of the box. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

However, the default implementation uses |@hboxsynced| in conjunction with |@beginpicture| to ensure that, if possible, hyperlinks survive in pdfs.

Warning: \ and PostScript differ with respect to the question of whether the current path is part of the graphic state or not.

**Package**: tikz  

### Description

y} This command is used to start a path at a specific point $(x,y)$ or to move the current point of the current path to $(x,y)$ without drawing anything upon stroking (the current path is ``interrupted''). Both x and y are given as \ dimensions. It is the driver's job to transform these to the coordinate system of the backend. Typically, this means converting the \ dimension into a dimensionless multiple of $1{72}in$. The function |@sys@bp| helps with this conversion. Draw a line from $(10pt,10p

### Description

Close the current path. This results in joining the current point of the path with the point specified by the last |@moveto| operation. Typically, this is preferable over using |@lineto| to the last point specified by a |@moveto|, since the line starting at this point and the line ending at this point will be smoothly joined by |@closepath|.

### Description

This command fills the area surrounded by the current path. If the path has not yet been closed, it is closed prior to filling. The path itself is not stroked. For self-intersecting paths or paths consisting of multiple parts, the nonzero winding number rule is used to determine whether a point is inside or outside the path, except if |@eorule| holds -- in which case the even-odd rule should be used.

## 3577. Command Specification

**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

First, the path is filled, then the path is stroked. If the fill and stroke colors are the same (or if they are not specified and the current color is used), this yields almost the same as a |@fill|. However, due to the line thickness of the stroked path, the fill-stroked area will be slightly larger. In addition to stroking and filling the path, the path will also be used for clipping if |@clipnext| is used prior to this command. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.
