### Description

anchorlabel textnamepath usage command} This command creates a new node. The shape of the node must have been declared previously using ||. The shape is shifted such that the anchor is at the origin. In order to place the shape somewhere else, use the coordinate transformation prior to calling this command. The name is a name for later reference. If no name is given, nothing will be ``saved'' for the node, it will just be drawn. The path usage command is executed for the background and the foreg

### Description

anchornamepath usage command} This command is the more general (and less user-friendly) version of the || command. While the || command can only be used for shapes that have a single part (which is the case for most shapes), this command can also be used with multi-part nodes. When this command is called, for each node part of the node you must have set up one -box. Suppose the shape has two parts: The |text| part and the |lower| part. Then, prior to calling ||, you must have set up the boxes ||

### Description

coordinate} This command creates a node of shape |coordinate| at the given coordinate. Exactly the same effect can be achieved using first a shift of the coordinate system to coordinate, followed by creating a node of shape |coordinate| named name. However, this command is easier and more natural to use and, more importantly, it is much faster.

### Description

Rather, when this command is used in a scope, all subsequent node creations in this scope will be affected in the following way: When a node is created, it is not inserted into the current picture. Instead, it is stored in the box ||. Furthermore, the node is not relevant for the picture's bounding box, but a bounding box for the node is computed and stored in the macros || to ||.

Provided this is the case, this command will insert the box into the current picture, shifted by coordinate. Then, the late code (see below) is called. Subsequently, you can refer to the node with its original name as if it had just been created. % %

However, When || is called, the code stored for the node is cleared.
