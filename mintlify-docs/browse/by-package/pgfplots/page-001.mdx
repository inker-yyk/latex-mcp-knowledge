## 201. Command

**ID**: `1dd1146065f0`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

Starts a new \ group (a local scope). The scope will be active until it will be closed by ||. The || command can occur later in the main token list.


---

## 202. Command

**ID**: `68d36fabec55`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

Ends a \ group which has been opened with ||.


---

## 203. Command

**ID**: `90c19501e2da`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

A special variant of || which can also be used to delimit arguments to || or || (i.e. it avoids the necessity to provide matched curly braces in this context). The || macro is also useful to test whether the next following character is an opening brace (see ||). If one just needs to open a \ group, one should prefer ||.

## 204. Command

**ID**: `44e4ccf26741`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

## 205. Command

**ID**: `1a9bb4246adf`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} The definition which follows || immediately will be done globally. codeexample[code only] { 123 0 by3 0={34} } codeexample


---

## 206. Command

**ID**: `f8454be07a73`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

(initially 0)} I cite from~texbook: ``If the || parameter is positive at the time of an assignment, a prefix of || is automatically implied; but if || is negative at the time of the assignment, a prefix of || is ignored. If || is zero (which it usually is), the appearance of nonappearance of || determines whether or not a global assignment is made.''


---

## 207. Command

**ID**: `4c4155999893`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

=count/integer numbertrue-block elsefalse-block fi} || compare integer numbers or integer registers (|| registers) and contains two branches, one is executed in the true case, the other in the case of false: codeexample[] 1=2 This is shown if above were true. This is shown if above results to false. codeexample Note that the || with its false-block is optional.


---

## 208. Command

**ID**: `017deb7eca61`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

=dimen/fixed point numbertrue-block elsefalse-block fi} Similar to ||, || compares two fixed point numbers or || registers. The numbers must have a unit. codeexample[] 1pt=2pt This is shown if above were true. This is shown if above results to false. codeexample


---

## 209. Command

**ID**: `697c85da0b19`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

token2true-block elsefalse-block fi} || is a bit more complex: It compares two tokens up to their first-level expansion. codeexample[] This is shown if the two tokens have equal expansion. This is shown if the two tokens expand to something different. codeexample Here, we have defined a token || to be a replacement for || and subsequently have compared whether these two tokens are equal in first-level expansion. Note that the definition is actually nonsense. If ever were to go through the whole 


---

## 210. Command

**ID**: `39cd67f17c22`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

token2true-block elsefalse-block fi} The || comparison is closely related to the || conditional, with one major exception: it expands tokens until it finds the next two unexpandable tokens. If these two tokens are the same, it expands to the true-block, otherwise to the false-block. The || conditional should be handled with care as it might produce undesirable effects. Use it only if you know what you do. A useful example is if you know that a macro contains at most one character, and you want t


---

## 211. Command

**ID**: `717522014899`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

elsefalse-block fi} A ``conditional'' which always invokes the true-block.


---

## 212. Command

**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} You can declare a new ``boolean variable `|| by means of ||. Afterwards, you can use the || and || switches to assign the boolean and || to check it. The if-name has to start with || (to support scans for nested |...| pairs, see below).


---

## 214. Command

**ID**: `3415cf3601de`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

value} This macro (re)defines a key. It is (almost) equivalent to a macro definition of sorts | key@|/key path/key name||value; i.e.\ it stores value into a new macro such that the key can be looked up in constant time in 's hash map. Note that in contrast to other key--value packages like |xkeyval|, the low--level macro name which is used to store the value is not part of the Keys that {key@ is unrelated to Keys.} -- use || and its friends to access the value. The only limit for the number of p

## 215. Command

**ID**: `313fe979eec4`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

macro} As you might have guessed, this macro allows to retrieve the value for some key and store it into macro. Now that we have read about || and ||, we can also provide an example: codeexample[] /notes/key{abc} /notes/key The value of key /notes/key is `'. codeexample There is few magic around these two keys; it is just like a hashmap access with some special naming convention for the keys (due to the key path). Note that since ``hashmap access'' is what \ does all the time when it handles mac


---

## 216. Command

**ID**: `dde4b2c12b86`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

macro} This is essentially the same as ||, except that the key's value is already available inside of macro: codeexample[] /notes/key{} /notes/key The value of key /notes/key is `'. codeexample Just like || boils down to ||, || boils down to ||.


---

## 217. Command

**ID**: `967cfc350283`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} This is essentially the same as ||/key path/key name macro macro; i.e.\ it expands to the value stored in a key. codeexample[] /notes/key{abc} The value of key /notes/key is `/notes/key'. codeexample However, this key has one major advantage: it can be used inside of an || (because it is fully expandable): codeexample[] /notes/key{abc} --- {/notes/key ---} The value of key /notes/key along with dashes is . codeexample It boils down to a suitable | ... |. Consequently, it expands to || if the k


---

## 218. Command

**ID**: `d1abda350970`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

macro body} This is a variant of ||. However, it has a substantial difference which appears to be unmotivated as long as we discuss the low--level . It defines a so--called code--key. Code--keys are executable macros. They take an argument, and they do something with it. ``Assigning values'' to such a key is equivalent to invoking macro body in a ``suitable'' way. The result of this macro call is a new key named /key path/key name/|.@cmd|. That key, in turn, is stored as executable macro. The ma

## 219. Command

**ID**: `4dcd7a576878`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} This key constitutes the public \ of Keys. It accepts any number of key--value pairs, separated by commas.


---

## 220. Command

**ID**: `8055c3647ccc`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} This macro is almost the same as ||comma--separated key--value pairs. In fact, if any assignments in its argument use fully--qualified paths (as we did so far in this document), both invocations are equivalent. The difference is how they treat keys which are relative to some current key path, a concept which will be explained in the next subsection. Here is the difference between the macros: || resets the current key path to |/| before processing its argument whereas || does not change the cur

The value is now `\the\count0'.
2. The following code will absorb the `3' of '3.':
\def\macro{1234}
\count0=\macro % a white space after a macro will be absorbed by TeX, so this is wrong.
3. The value is now `\the\count0'.
4. Use \textbackslash relax after an assignment to end scanning:
\count0=\macro\relax
5. The value is now `\the\count0'.
