### Description

} A command to execute low-level path commands in a axis. Since any drawing commands inside of an axis need to be postponed until the axis is complete and the scaling has been initialised, it is not possible to simply draw any paths. Instead, it is necessary to draw them as soon as the axis is finished. This is done automatically for every path -- and it is also done manually if you write ||commands. codeexample[] tikzpicture axis[xmin=0,xmax=3,ymin=0,ymax=5] {{1{2}} {2{4}} stroke } axis tikzpic

**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

{ text}} A variant of || which provides a method to deal with macros inside of { text}. Suppose { text} contains some sort of parameter which varies for every plot. Moreover, you like to use a loop to generate the plots. Then, it is simpler to use ||: codeexample[] tikzpicture axis in {1,2,3} { {x^}; $x^$ } axis tikzpicture codeexample Note that this example wouldn't have worked with |$x^$| because the macro || is no longer defined when attempts to draw the legend.

## 281. Command

**ID**: `dc13ba490913`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} This command poses an equivalent alternative for ||name: it has essentially the same effect, but it does not create links when used with the |hyperref| package.Since this manual uses colored links, the text in { would usually be blue. Using avoids link text colors in the legend (this has been applied to the manual styles here).}

## 282. Command

**ID**: `14bf14545431`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} Adds a further legend image for legend creation. Each || command appends its plot style options to a list, and || adds options to the very same list. Thus, the effect is as if you had provided ||options, but || bypasses all the logic usually associated with a plot. In other words: except for the legend, the state of the axis remains as if the command would not have been issued. Not even the current plot's index is advanced. codeexample[] tikzpicture semilogyaxis[ domain=0:4, ] {x}; $x$ {x^2};

y dimension} Adds a point to the convex hull of the arrow tip. As for the previous commands, no math parsing is done; instead \ says |@x=|x dimension and then |@y=|y dimension. Thus, both ``dimensions'' can contain code for advancing and thus modifying |@x| and |@y|. In our example we would write codeexample[code only] 1cm{0pt} -3cm{2cm} -3cm{-2cm} codeexample

### Description

y dimension} This command works like the previous command, only it normally adds two points to the convex hull: First, the point $(x dimension,y dimension)$ and, secondly, the point $(x dimension,-y dimension)$. However, the second point is only added if the arrow is not a harpoon. Thus, in our example we could simplify the convex hull to codeexample[code only] 1cm{0pt} -3cm{2cm} codeexample If the y dimension is zero or less, only one point, namely $(x dimension,y dimension)$, is added to the h

### Description

} This command should be called by keys with the prefix |/pgf/arrow keys| to add code to the arrow option cache. For our |depth| key example, we could use this key as follows: codeexample[code only] /pgf/arrow keys/depth/.code= {{{#1}} codeexample Actually, this is still not optimal since the expensive || command is now called each time an arrow tip is used with the |depth| option set. The trick is to do the expensive operation only once and then store only very quick code in the arrow option ca


---

## 306. Command

**ID**: `8c4ae20db260`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command works like ||, only the code will be executed ``later'' than the code added by the normal version of the command. This is useful for keys that depend on the length of an arrow: Keys like |width'| want to define the arrow width as a multiple of the arrow length, but when the |width'| key is given, the length may not yet have been specified. By making the computation of the width a ``late'' option, we ensure that || will have been setup correctly.

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

}} Renormalizes x to extended precision mantissa, meaning $100 m < 1000$ instead of $1 m < 10$. The ``extended precision'' means we have higher accuracy when we apply pgfmath operations to mantissas. The input argument is expected to be a normalized floating point number; the output argument is a non-normalized floating point number (well, normalized to extended precision). The operation is supposed to be very fast.

The computation is performed in floating point arithmetic, that means we compute $m fixed$ and renormalize the result where $m$ is the mantissa of float. This operation renormalizes float with || before the operation, that means it is intended for relatively small arguments of fixed. The result is a floating point number.

}} Defines || to be the natural logarithm of x, $(x)$. This method is logically the same as ||, but it applies floating point arithmetic to read number x and employs the logarithm identity \[ (m 10^e) = (m) + e (10) \] to get the result. The factor $(10)$ is a constant, so only $(m)$ with $1 m < 10$ needs to be computed. This is done using standard pgf math operations. Please note that x needs to be a number, expression parsing is not possible here. If x is not a bounded positive real number (fo
