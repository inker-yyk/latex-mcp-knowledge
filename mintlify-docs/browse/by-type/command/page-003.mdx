**ID**: `4f4ce1481085`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command will execute the mark code for some points of the plot, but each time the coordinate transformation matrix will be set up such that the origin is at the position of the point to be plotted. This way, if the mark code draws a little circle around the origin, little circles will be drawn at some point of the plot. By default, a mark is drawn at all points of the plot. However, two parameters $r$ and $p$ influence this. First, only every $r$th mark is drawn. Second, the first mark dr

## 625. Command

**ID**: `bd49c5520404`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This command will turn the current soft path in a ``hard'' path. To do so, it iterates over the soft path and calls an appropriate |@xxxx| command for each element of the path. Note that the current soft path is not changed by this command. Thus, in order to start a new soft path after the old one has been invoked and is no longer needed, you need to set the current soft path to be empty. This may seem strange, but it is often useful to immediately use the last soft path again.

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command works similarly to the || command. However, before inserting the text in box number, the current coordinate transformation matrix is applied to the current canvas transformation matrix (is it ``synced'' with this matrix, hence the name). Thus, this command basically has the same effect as if you first called || followed by ||. However, this command will use || and || commands for the ``translational part'' of the coordinate transformation matrix, instead of adding the translationa

## 666. Command

**ID**: `85cc43f09625`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Called to insert a (horizontal) TeX box inside a |{pgfpicture}|, but with the current coordinate transformation matrix synced with the canvas transformation matrix. This command should do the same as if you used || followed by |@hbox|. However, the default implementation of this command will use a ``TeX-translation'' for the translation part of the transformation matrix. This will ensure that hyperlinks ``survive'' at least translations. On the other hand, a driver may choose to revert to a si

## 667. Command

**ID**: `19378eb71d93`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Basically, this should do the same as doing a (scoped) low level sync followed by inserting the box box number directly into the output stream. However, the default implementation uses |@hboxsynced| in conjunction with |@beginpicture| to ensure that, if possible, hyperlinks survive in pdfs. Drivers that are sensitive to picture-in-picture scopes should replace this implementation by codeexample[code only] @beginscope#1@endscope codeexample

All changes to the graphic state parameters mentioned for |@stroke| and |@fill| will be local to the current graphic state and the old values will be restored after |@endscope| is used. Warning: \ and PostScript differ with respect to the question of whether the current path is part of the graphic state or not. For this reason, you should never use this command unless the path is currently empty. For example, it might be a good idea to us

**ID**: `cf724402c339`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

y} This command is used to start a path at a specific point $(x,y)$ or to move the current point of the current path to $(x,y)$ without drawing anything upon stroking (the current path is ``interrupted''). Both x and y are given as \ dimensions. It is the driver's job to transform these to the coordinate system of the backend. Typically, this means converting the \ dimension into a dimensionless multiple of $1{72}in$. The function |@sys@bp| helps with this conversion. Draw a line from $(10pt,10p

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

Close the current path. This results in joining the current point of the path with the point specified by the last |@moveto| operation. Typically, this is preferable over using |@lineto| to the last point specified by a |@moveto|, since the line starting at this point and the line ending at this point will be smoothly joined by |@closepath|. Consider codeexample[code only] @moveto{0pt}{0pt} @lineto{10bp}{10bp} @lineto{0bp}{10bp} @closepath @stroke codeexample and codeexample[code only] @moveto{0

### Description

This command fills the area surrounded by the current path. If the path has not yet been closed, it is closed prior to filling. The path itself is not stroked. For self-intersecting paths or paths consisting of multiple parts, the nonzero winding number rule is used to determine whether a point is inside or outside the path, except if |@eorule| holds -- in which case the even-odd rule should be used. (See the \ or PostScript manual for details.) The following graphic state parameters influence t

## 684. Command

**ID**: `b4e23322a515`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

First, the path is filled, then the path is stroked. If the fill and stroke colors are the same (or if they are not specified and the current color is used), this yields almost the same as a |@fill|. However, due to the line thickness of the stroked path, the fill-stroked area will be slightly larger. In addition to stroking and filling the path, the path will also be used for clipping if |@clipnext| is used prior to this command. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.
