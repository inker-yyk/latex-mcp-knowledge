**ID**: `455498e20749`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

When an animation ends, the question is whether the ``effect'' of the animation (like changing a color or translating the coordinate system) should disappear or ``remain in force''. Using this key, you specify that at the end of the animation the last value of the attributes stays in effect. codeexample[ width=6cm, preamble={animations}, animation list={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, ] node{}{ 0{1}{1}{0}{0} 0cm{0cm} 2{1}{1}{0}{0} 0cm{-1cm} translate } codeexample

**ID**: `21658e37342d`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

head{->}body{`\}}} Declare a rule. head should consist of a single symbol, which need not have been declared using || or exist as a default symbol (in fact, the more interesting L-systems depend on using symbols with no corresponding code, to control the ``growth'' of the system). body consists of a string of symbols, which again need not necessarily have any code associated with them.


---

## 1023. Command

**ID**: `f4148ba284ad`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

axiomorder} Runs the L-system called name using the input string axiom for order iterations. In general, prior to calling this command, the transformation matrix should be set appropriately for shifting and rotating, and a move-to to the (transformed) origin should be executed. This origin will be where the L-system starts. In addition, the relevant keys should be set appropriately. codeexample[preamble={lindenmayersystems}] tikzpicture [help lines] grid (3,2); lindenmayer system/.cd, angle=60, 


---

## 1024. Command

**ID**: `1a6a103dc01b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

token text} Stores the token text in the full key. The full key may not be a partial key, so no default-path-adding is done. The token text can be arbitrary tokens and may even contain things like |#| or unbalanced -ifs. codeexample[] /my family/my key{Hello, world!} /my family/my key codeexample The setting of a key is always local to the current \ group.


---

## 1025. Command

**ID**: `d1b1b9aacb20`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

token text} The || version of ||.


---

## 1026. Command

**ID**: `99a71df49858`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

macro} Performs a || statement so the full key points to the contents of macro. codeexample[] , world! /my family/my key{} /my family/my key codeexample You should never let a key be equal to ||. Such a key may or may not be indistinguishable from an undefined key.


---

## 1027. Command

**ID**: `ea0d7a6d0e33`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

macro} Retrieves the tokens stored in the full key and lets macro be equal to these tokens. If the key has not been set, the macro will be equal to ||. codeexample[] /my family/my key{Hello, world!} /my family/my key{} codeexample


---

## 1028. Command

**ID**: `879ce9148474`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Inserts the value stored in full key at the current position into the text. It expands to an alias of the primitive || if the key is undefined. codeexample[] /my family/my key{Hello, world!} /my family/my key codeexample Note: It is an error to assign to the result of the expansion of ||, not only semantically but in recent versions of \ also logically. To set the value of a key always use the appropriate interfaces, e.g.\ ||.


---

## 1029. Command

**ID**: `c145a702c4ef`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

ifelse} Checks whether this key was previously set using either || or ||. If so, the code in if is executed, otherwise the code in else. codeexample[] /my family/my key{Hello, world!} /my family/my key{yes}{no} codeexample


---

## 1030. Command

**ID**: `d69c036ff2a0`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

ifelse} Checks whether this key was previously set using either ||, ||, ||, or one of ||'s relatives. If so, the code in if is executed, otherwise the code in else. codeexample[] /my family/my keyA{#1} /my family/my keyB{Hello, world!} /my family/my keyA{yes}{no} /my family/my keyB{yes}{no} codeexample


---

## 1031. Command

**ID**: `64cbb537f78b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} The key list should be a list of key--value pairs, separated by commas. A key--value pair can have the following two forms: key|=|value or just key. Any spaces around the key or around the value are removed. It is permissible to surround both the key or the value in curly braces, which are also removed. Especially putting the value in curly braces needs to be done quite often, namely whenever the value contains an equal-sign or a comma. The key--value pairs in the list are handled in the order


---

## 1032. Command

**ID**: `058378a0b288`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

key list} This command has the same effect as ||{default path|/.cd,|key list|}|, it is only marginally quicker. This command should not be used in user code, but rather in commands like || or || that get called very often.


---

## 1033. Command

**ID**: `524182c3e1a4`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command has exactly the same effect as ||, only the default path is not modified before or after the keys are being set. This command is mainly intended to be called by the code that is being processed for a key.


---

## 1034. Command

**ID**: `e6b8cc7d6baf`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

key list} This command has the same effect as ||{default path|/.cd,|key list|}|, it is only quicker. Changing the default path inside a || is dangerous, so use with care. A rather safe place to call this command is at the beginning of a \ group.


---

## 1035. Command

**ID**: `f53a4f3162b2`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} This command temporarily defines a -macro with the argument list |#1| and then lets key|/.@cmd| be equal to this macro. The net effect of all this is that you have then set up code for the key key so that when you write ||{key|=|value|}|, then the code is executed with all occurrences of |#1| in code being replaced by value. (This behavior is quite similar to the |@key| command of |keyval| and |xkeyval|). codeexample[] /my key{#1, #1.} /my key=hello codeexample


---

## 1036. Command

**ID**: `f751a2b8f7f6`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} This command works like ||, but it uses || rather than || when defining the key macro. If you do not know the difference between the two, then you will not need this command; and if you know the difference, then you will know when you need this command.


---

## 1037. Command

**ID**: `b4a031c35386`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

argument countcode} This command works like ||, but it allows you to provide an arbitrary argument count between $0$ and $9$ (inclusive). codeexample[preamble={shortvrb \|}] /my key{2}{#1#2} /my key= {hello {world}} || is `', || is `'. codeexample The resulting key will expect exactly argument count arguments.


---

## 1038. Command

**ID**: `e0be94f4715b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

argument countcode} The || version of ||.


---

## 1039. Command

**ID**: `599a5881a801`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

argument patterncode} This command works like ||, but it allows you to provide an arbitrary argument pattern rather than just a number of arguments. codeexample[preamble={shortvrb \|}] /my key{#1+#2}{#1#2} /my key=hello+world || is `', || is `'. codeexample Note that || is better when it comes to simple argument countsWhen the resulting keys are used, the {defnargs variant allows spaces between arguments whereas the defargs variant does not; it considers the spaces as part of the argument.}.


---

## 1040. Command

**ID**: `98f5bc0555e4`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

inline data}} This command is used to feed data to the visualization pipeline. This command can only be used when a data visualization object has been properly setup, see Section~section-dv-main-setup. Basic options. The || command may be followed by options, which are executed with the path |/pgf/data/|. Depending on these options, the options may either be followed by inline data or, alternatively, no inline data is present and the data is read from an external source. The first important opti

## 1043. Command

**ID**: `18e90364c9ca`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

catcode codestartup codeline arguments\ codeempty line codeend code } This command defines a new data format called format name, which can subsequently be used in the || command. (The 's |data| maps directly to ||, so the following applies to \ as well.) As explained in the description of the || command, when data is being parsed that is formatted according to format name, the following happens: enumerate The catcode code is executed. This code should just contain catcode changes. The catcode co

## 1044. Command

**ID**: `91deb51594d2`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

anchorlabel textnamepath usage command} This command creates a new node. The shape of the node must have been declared previously using ||. The shape is shifted such that the anchor is at the origin. In order to place the shape somewhere else, use the coordinate transformation prior to calling this command. The name is a name for later reference. If no name is given, nothing will be ``saved'' for the node, it will just be drawn. The path usage command is executed for the background and the foreg


---

## 1045. Command

**ID**: `31e9df2cea08`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

anchornamepath usage command} This command is the more general (and less user-friendly) version of the || command. While the || command can only be used for shapes that have a single part (which is the case for most shapes), this command can also be used with multi-part nodes. When this command is called, for each node part of the node you must have set up one -box. Suppose the shape has two parts: The |text| part and the |lower| part. Then, prior to calling ||, you must have set up the boxes ||


---

## 1046. Command

**ID**: `b151ff8f0895`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

coordinate} This command creates a node of shape |coordinate| at the given coordinate. Exactly the same effect can be achieved using first a shift of the coordinate system to coordinate, followed by creating a node of shape |coordinate| named name. However, this command is easier and more natural to use and, more importantly, it is much faster.


---

## 1047. Command

**ID**: `9d7ad2a52876`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

existing node} This command does not actually create a new node. Rather, it allows you to subsequently access the node existing node using the name new name.


---

## 1048. Command

**ID**: `e854813fc2a1`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

existing node} This command renames an existing node.


---

## 1049. Command

**ID**: `56a6037bf697`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command is not a replacement for ||. Rather, when this command is used in a scope, all subsequent node creations in this scope will be affected in the following way: When a node is created, it is not inserted into the current picture. Instead, it is stored in the box ||. Furthermore, the node is not relevant for the picture's bounding box, but a bounding box for the node is computed and stored in the macros || to ||. Then, the macro name is called with the following macros set up: command


---

## 1050. Command

**ID**: `5604f1331452`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

The name of the just-created-node. This name will be the originally ``desired'' name of the box plus the fixed prefix |not yet positionedPGFINTERNAL|. The idea is to ensure that the original name is not inadvertently used before the node is actually positioned. When || is called, it will change the name to the original name.


---

## 1051. Command

**ID**: `7b5a1c67f6de`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

The minimal $x$-position of a bounding box of the node. This bounding box refers to the node when it is positioned with the anchor at the origin. It is guaranteed, that this macro will contain a dimension in the format number|pt|.

---

## 1056. Command

**ID**: `2097828dfb69`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command is used to position a node that has previously been created using the command ||. When || is called, the macros and boxes mentioned in the description of || must be set to the value they had when the macro name was called. Provided this is the case, this command will insert the box into the current picture, shifted by coordinate. Then, the late code (see below) is called. Subsequently, you can refer to the node with its original name as if it had just been created. codeexample[] =

## 1057. Command

**ID**: `1b1bc769462b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} When you call this macro inside a scope for which the || has been called, the code will be stored internally. Later, when the node named node name is actually positioned using ||, the code will be executed. When this macro is called multiple times with the same node name, the code accumulates. However, When || is called, the code stored for the node is cleared. The main purpose of this mechanism is to allow \ to store so-called ``late options'' with a node that will be positioned only late

**ID**: `78ec38e00332`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

anchor} This command is another ``point command'' like the commands described in Section~section-points. It returns the coordinate of the given anchor in the given node. The command can be used in commands like ||. codeexample[] pgfpicture 30 rectangle{center}{Hello World!}{x}{stroke} {x{north}}{2pt} {x{south}}{2pt} {x{east}}{2pt} {x{west}}{2pt} {x{north east}}{2pt} fill pgfpicture codeexample In the above example, you may have noticed something curious: The rotation transformation is still in f

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

point} This command returns the point on the border of the shape that lies on a straight line from the center of the node to point. For complex shapes it is not guaranteed that this point will actually lie on the border, it may be on the border of a ``simplified'' version of the shape. codeexample[] pgfpicture pgfscope 30 rectangle{center}{Hello World!}{x}{stroke} pgfscope {x{2cm{1cm}}}{2pt} {2cm{1cm}}{2pt} {x{-1cm{1cm}}}{2pt} {-1cm{1cm}}{2pt} fill pgfpicture codeexample Remark: If the given poi

## 1060. Command

**ID**: `da4ab0c6d3bc`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

shape specification} This command declares a new shape named shape name. The shape name can later be used in commands like ||. The shape specification is some \ code containing calls to special commands that are only defined inside the shape specification (similarly to commands like || that are only available inside the |{tikzpicture}| environment). Here is the code of the |coordinate| shape: codeexample[code only] coordinate { @x=.5 @y=.5 @y by -.5 center{} } codeexample The special commands ar

## 1061. Command

**ID**: `cc9b062a70e6`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} This command declares a saved anchor. The argument command should be a \ macro name like ||. The code will be executed each time || (or ||) is called to create a node of the shape shape name. When the code is executed, the -boxes of the node parts will contain the text labels of the node. Possibly, these box are void. For example, if there is just a |text| part, the node || will be set up when the code is executed. The code can use the width, height, and depth of the box(es) to compute the

## 1062. Command

**ID**: `a974b53eeb58`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} This command is similar to ||, only instead of setting command to ||$x$|{|$y$|}|, the command is set just to (the value of) $x$. In the |simple rectangle| shape we might use a saved dimension to store the depth of the shape box. codeexample[code only] { @x= } codeexample

## 1063. Command

**ID**: `20877c4f57a7`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} This command is similar to ||, only at some point in code, command should be defined appropriately, (this could be a value, or some text). In the |regular polygon| shape, a saved macro is used to store the number of sides of the polygon. codeexample[code only] {} codeexample


---

## 1064. Command

**ID**: `1cb579ab0801`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} This command declares an anchor named name. Unlike for saved anchors, the code will not be executed each time a node is declared. Rather, the code is only executed when the anchor is specifically requested; either for anchoring the node during its creation or as a position in the shape referenced later on. The name is a quite arbitrary string that is not ``passed down'' to the system level. Thus, names like |south| or |1| or |::| would all be fine. A saved anchor is not automatically also

## 1065. Command

**ID**: `de2db4ffbffd`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

code} This command declares an anchor named name. It works like ||. However, unlike for anchors declared by ||, name will not be expanded during the shape declaration (i.e.\ not during ||). Rather, the name is expanded when the node is actually used (with || or more likely with ||). This may be useful if the anchor name is context dependent (depending, for example, on the value of a key). codeexample[code only] simple shape{ { } center{} { @x=1cm @y=0cm} anchor {}} tikzpicture [simple shape] (Te

## 1066. Command

**ID**: `77d9eed40ac3`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} A border anchor is an anchor point on the border of the shape. What exactly is considered as the ``border'' of the shape depends on the shape. When the user requests a point on the border of the shape using the || command, the code will be executed to discern this point. When the execution of the code starts, the dimensions |@x| and |@y| will have been set to a location $p$ in the shape's coordinate system, and relative to the anchor |center|. Note that || will produce an error if the shape do

## 1067. Command

**ID**: `1813648c583b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command specifies the path that ``makes up'' the background of the shape. Note that the shape cannot prescribe what is going to happen with the path: It might be drawn, shaded, filled, or even thrown away. If you want to specify that something should ``always'' happen when this shape is drawn (for example, if the shape is a stop-sign, we always want it to be filled with a red color), you can use commands like ||, explained below. When the code is executed, all saved anchors will be in eff

## 1069. Command

**ID**: `a9842a9f4116`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Unlike the previous two commands, code should not only construct a path, it should also use this path in whatever way is appropriate. For example, the code might fill some area with a uniform color. Whatever the code does, it does it first. This means that any drawing done by code will be even behind the background path. Note that the code is protected with a |{pgfscope}|.

**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

|]|} This command allows you to inherit the code for saved anchors from another shape name. The idea is that if you wish to create a new shape that is just a small modification of a another shape, you can recycle the code used for another shape name. The effect of this command is the same as if you had called || and || for each saved anchor or saved dimension declared in another shape name. Thus, it is not possible to ``selectively'' inherit only some saved anchors, you always have to inherit al
