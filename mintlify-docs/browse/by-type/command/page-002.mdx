**ID**: `28f6bdea79f5`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

options} Adds an animation of the attribute of a future object to the current graphic. Attributes are things like the ``fill opacity'' or the transformation matrix or the line width. The options are keys that configure how the attribute changes over time. Using the |entry| key multiple times, you specify which value the chosen attribute should have at different points in time. Unless special keys are used, ``outside'' the specified timeline the animation has no effect: codeexample[ preamble={ani

## 412. Command

**ID**: `5888b764c9ed`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} When this command is used inside a \ scope, the behavior of || changes: Instead of adding an animation to the object and the attribute, the object's attribute is set to value it would have during the animation at time time. Note that when this command is used in a \ scope, no animation is created and no support by the driver is needed (so, it works with pdf). codeexample[preamble={animations}] [make snapshot of=1s, animate = { myself: = { :rotate = { 0s = "0", 2s = "90" }, :color = { 0s = "red

## 421. Command

**ID**: `f23de383b452`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

counterprefix} This command is used to ``prepare'' the nodes of a certain color for random access. The effect is the following: It is counted how many nodes there are having color color name in the current group and the result is stored in counter. Next, macros named prefix|1|, prefix|2|, and so on are defined, that store the names of the first, second, third, and so on node having the color color name. The net effect is that after you have prepared a color, you can quickly iterate over them. Th

## 425. Command

**ID**: `5df470c46527`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This command signals that a plot stream starts. The effect of this command is to call the internal command |@plotstreamstart|, which is set by the current plot handler to do whatever needs to be done at the beginning of the plot. It will also reset the meaning of the internal commands like |@plotstreampoint| to the initial setting for the plot handler (what this means will be explained in a moment).


---

## 426. Command

**ID**: `ceb86c16b8f0`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command adds a point to the current plot stream. The effect of this command is to call the internal command |@plotstreampoint|, which is also set by the current plot handler. This command should now ``handle'' the point in some sensible way. For example, a line-to command might be issued for the point. When a plot handler is installed, it will setup the internal command |@plotstreampoint| in some way. It is permissible to change the meaning of this internal command during a stream. For in

## 428. Command

**ID**: `2fe9463186af`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This command indicated that the stream contains an ``undefined'' point like a point where some coordinate results for a division by zero. Such a point cannot be plotted, which is why it is not given as a parameter. However, such a point can result in a jump in the plot, depending on the setting of the following key: key{/pgf/handle undefined points in plots=how (initially jump)} tikz You can set how to one of the following values: itemize |ignore| The undefined point will be completely ignored, 


---

## 429. Command

**ID**: `38d7369f1126`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This command indicated that in the stream a ``new data set'' starts. So, the stream does not end, but there is a logical break in the data. For example, when a table is read from a file, empty lines are interpreted as indicating new data sets. What happens when a new data set is encountered is governed by the following key: key{/pgf/handle new data sets in plots=how (initially jump)} tikz You can set how to one of the following values: itemize |ignore| The command will be completely ignored, jus

**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

node optionsnode text} A subgraph node is a node that ``surrounds'' the nodes of a subgraph. The special property of a subgraph node opposed to a normal node is that it is created only after the subgraph has been laid out. However, the difference to a collection like |hyper| is that the node is available immediately as a normal node in the sense that you can connect edges to it. What happens internally is that subgraph nodes get ``registered'' immediately both on the \ level and on the Lua level

This is identical to what the ``orthogonal'' transformation above also does. The difference is that a line from $(0,0)$ to $(0,y)$ gets still transformed to an initial segment of the curve of a length of $y$, but now rotated by $90^$. In general, the point $p =

## 585. Command

**ID**: `cda0d206f0cb`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} A variant of || which will expand all arguments for profiler entry name before showing them. The invocation as such is not affected by this expansion. This expansion (with ||) might yield unrecoverable errors for some commands. Handle with care.


---

## 586. Command

**ID**: `07e6c3339e9b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

environment name} Defines a new profiler entry which measures time spent in the environment environment name. This calls || and handles the begin/end of the environment automatically. The argument for || is profiler entry name, or, if this optional argument is not used, it is ` name' where || is predefined as |<ENV>|. Again, it is permitted to use the same profiler entry name multiple times to merge different commands into one output section.


---

## 587. Command

**ID**: `0a3d36afbff8`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Starts (or resumes) timing of profiler entry name. The argument must have been declared in the preamble using ||. Nested calls of || with the same argument will be ignored. The invocation of this command doesn't change the environment: it doesn't introduce any \ groups nor does it modify the token list.


---

## 588. Command

**ID**: `84b850ab22ae`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Stops (or interrupts) timing of profiler entry name. This command finishes a preceding call to ||.


---

## 589. Command

**ID**: `b1485c70c34b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

For , this command is installed automatically in |document|. It stops all running timings, evaluates them and returns the result into the logfile. Furthermore, it generates a text table called |.profiler.|YYYY|-|MM|-|DD|_|HH|h_|MM|m.dat| with the same information. Note that the |profiler| library predefines two profiler entries, namely |main job| which counts time from the beginning of the document until || and |preamble| which counts time from the beginning of the document until |document|.

## 590. Command

**ID**: `5acd9c473ab4`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

(initially main job)} Sets the profiler entry whose total time will be used to compute all other relative times. Thus, profiler entry name will use $100\ total time per definition, all other relative times are relative to this one.


---

## 591. Command

**ID**: `9202b6e51bdf`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

true codefalse code} Invokes true code if profiler entry name is currently running and false code otherwise.


---

## 592. Command

**ID**: `f369813f70ca`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This handler will issue a || command for each point of the plot, except possibly for the first. As for the line-to handler, what happens with the first point can be specified using || or ||. Obviously, the || command needs, in addition to the points on the path, some control points. These are generated automatically using a somewhat ``dumb'' algorithm: Suppose you have three points $x$, $y$, and $z$ on the curve such that $y$ is between $x$ and $z$: codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x

## 593. Command

**ID**: `4b291303c9bb`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} Sets the factor used by the curve plot handlers to determine the distance of the control points from the points they control. The higher the curvature of the curve points, the higher this value should be. A value of $1$ will cause four points at quarter positions of a circle to be connected using a circle. The default is $0.5$. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x} (1,1) node {y} (2,.5) node {z}; 0.75 {0cm{0cm}} {1cm{1cm}} {2cm{0.5cm}} stroke tikzpicture codeexample


---

## 594. Command

**ID**: `3d14d1efa7ed`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This handler works like the curve-to plot handler, only it will add a new part to the current path that is a closed curve through the plot points. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x} (1,1) node {y} (2,.5) node {z}; {0cm{0cm}} {1cm{1cm}} {2cm{0.5cm}} stroke tikzpicture codeexample


---

## 595. Command

**ID**: `de0512210e46`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This handler works like the line-to plot handler, only it will produce a connected, piecewise constant path to connect the points. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x} (1,1) node {y} (2,.5) node {z}; {0cm{0cm}} {1cm{1cm}} {2cm{0.5cm}} stroke tikzpicture codeexample

### Description

A variant of || which places its mark on the center of the line. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x} (1,1) node {y} (2,.5) node {z}; {0cm{0cm}} {1cm{1cm}} {2cm{0.5cm}} stroke tikzpicture codeexample The plot handler always connects two data points by a horizontal line starting from the previous data points, followed by a vertical line in the middle between the two data points, followed by a horizontal line between the middle and the current data point. This results in a symmetric con


---

## 598. Command

**ID**: `a21976a9a113`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This handler works like the line-to plot handler, only it will produce a non-connected, piecewise constant path to connect the points. If there are any plot marks, they will be placed on the left open pieces. codeexample[] tikzpicture [gray] (0,0) node {x} (1,1) node {y} (2,.5) node {z}; {0cm{0cm}} {1cm{1cm}} {2cm{0.5cm}} stroke tikzpicture codeexample
