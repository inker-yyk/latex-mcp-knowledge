initial statestates} This command declares a new decoration called name. The states argument contains a description of the decoration automaton's states and the transitions between them. The initial state is the state in which the automaton starts. When the automaton is later applied to an input path, it keeps track of a certain position on the input path. This current point will ``travel along the path'', each time being moved along by a certain distance. This will also work if the path is not

## 838. Command

**ID**: `5db05afa1272`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This macro parses expression and returns the result without units in the macro ||. |2pt+3.5pt| will set || to the text |5.5|. In the following, the special properties of this command are explained. The exact syntax of mathematical expressions is explained in Sections pgfmath-operators and~pgfmath-functions. itemize The result stored in the macro || is a decimal without units. This is true regardless of whether the expression contains any unit specification. All numbers with units are converted


---

## 839. Command

**ID**: `0c665ccdc61e`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This macro is similar to ||: it parses expression and returns the result in the macro ||. It differs in two respects. Firstly, || does not parse functions, scientific notation, the prefixes for binary octal, or hexadecimal numbers, nor does it accept the special use of |"|, |?| or |:| characters. Secondly, numbers in expression must specify a unit (except in such instances as |0.5@x|), which greatly simplifies the problem of parsing real numbers. As a result of these restrictions || is about t

## 840. Command

**ID**: `6e7b5a6aa29b`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

At the end of the parse this command is executed, allowing some custom action to be performed on the result of the parse. When this command is executed, the macro || will hold the result of the parse (as always, without units). The result of the custom action should be used to redefine || appropriately. By default, this command is equivalent to ||. This differs from previous versions, where, if the parsed expression contained no units, the result of the parse was scaled according to the value in


---

## 841. Command

**ID**: `b89178b9b3c3`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

expression} Basically, this command sets the length of the register to the value specified by expression. However, there is some fine print: First, in case expression starts with a |+|, a simple \ assignment is done. In particular, register can be a glue register and expression be something like |+1pt plus 1fil| and the register will be assigned the expected value. Second, when the expression does not start with |+|, it is first parsed using ||, resulting in a (dimensionless) value ||. Now, if t

## 850. Command

**ID**: `d900d357b572`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

After a call of || this if will be true exactly if some unit was encountered in the expression. It is always set globally in each call. Note that any ``mentioning'' of a unit inside an expression will set this -if to true. In particular, even an expressionlike |2pt/1pt|, which arguably should be considered ``scalar'' or ``unit-free'' will still have this -if set to true. However, see the |scalar| function for a way to change this.


---

## 851. Command

**ID**: `5b4bc4c0ba9e`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This -if is similar to ||, but it is only set when the unit |mu| is encountered at least once. In this case, || will also be set to true. The |scalar| function has no effect on this -if.

### Description

{`\{}radius|/|{y-radius}{`\}}} This command is similar to the || command, but the radius is now a factor to be interpreted in the $xy$-coordinate system. This means that a degree of |0| is the same as the $x$-vector of the $xy$-coordinate system times radius and a degree of |90| is the $y$-vector times radius. As for ||, a radius can also be a pair separated by a slash. In this case, the $x$- and $y$-vectors are multiplied by different factors. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (

If point is the $0$-vector or extremely short, a vector of length 1pt pointing upwards is returned.
