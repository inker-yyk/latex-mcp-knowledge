The date should expand to a string of the following form: % enumerate calendar-date-format It should start with a number representing the year. Use || for the current year, that is, the year the file is being typeset. The year must be followed by a hyphen. Next should come a number representing the month. Use || for the current month.

### Description

This macro expands to a suggested name for nodes representing days in a calendar. If the prefix is empty, it expands to the empty string, otherwise it expands to the prefix of the calendar, followed by a hyphen, followed by the ISO format version of the date. Thus, when the date |2007-01-01| is typeset in a calendar for the prefix |mycal|, the macro expands to |mycal-2007-01-01|.

### Description

This command causes the ``garbage collector'' to be invoked. The job of this garbage collector is to free the global -macros that are used by ``dead'' objects (objects whose life-time has ended). This macro is called automatically after every scope in which an object has been created, so you normally do not need to call this macro yourself.

Just like class names, method names can contain spaces and other characters, so method names like |put_stamp_here| or |put stamp here| are both legal. Three method names are special: First, a method having either the same name as the class or having the name |init| is called the constructor of the class. There are (currently) no destructors; objects simply become
