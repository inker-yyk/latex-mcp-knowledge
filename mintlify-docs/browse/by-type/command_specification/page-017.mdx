### Description

} Given that some intersections have been computed already (and are in the current scope), this command computes the intersection segments for one of the input arguments. On output, || contains the number of computed segments. The segments as such can be accessed via ||. The argument 1 or 2 should be |1| if intersection segments of the first argument of || are to be computed and |2| if the second argument should be used as input. This macro is part of |fillbetween|.

The value 1 or 2 resembles the argument of a preceding call to ||: it identifies which of the two paths for which intersections have been computed is to be selected. The second argument index is a number $0 i < N$ where $N$ is the total number of computed segments. The total number of computed segments is returned by ||. This macro

### Description

} There are 256 Integer registers which provide 32 Bit Integer arithmetics. The registers can be used for example with |0=42 | or |7= | where || expands to a number. The value of a register can be typeset using ||register. The `|=|' sign is optional and can be omitted. One thing is common among the registers: an assignment of the form |0=|$$ expands everything which follows until the expansion doesn't need more numbers -- even more than one following macro. The precise rules can be found in~texb

### Description

} There are also 255 registers for fixed point numbers which are used pretty much in the same way as the || registers -- but || register assignments require a unit like `|cm|' or `|pt|'. String access with `||' works in exactly the same way as for || registers. The same rules with expansion of macros after assignments apply here as well. The || registers perform their arithmetics internally with 32 bit scaled integers, so called `scaled point' with unit `|sp|'. It holds |1pt=65536sp|=$2^{16}$|sp
