**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} This command can only be called when the node named node name has already been created inside the current graph drawing scope. The effect of calling this macro will be that all options currently on the graph drawing system's option stack will be added to the node's option, possibly overwriting the original option settings. Furthermore, the node will become part of all layouts currently on the option stack. This means that you can use this command to add a node to several layouts that are not i

### Description

} This command sets up macro as the macro that is called whenever a layout key ``requests'' that a layout and, possibly, a graph drawing scope is opened. When macro is called, it gets two parameters, the begin code and the end code. In addition to whatever setup the macro would like to do, it should execute the begin code at the beginning of a \ scope (the code will open graph drawing and layout scopes) and the end code at the end of the same \ scope. The need for this slightly strange macro ari

### Description

node optionsnode text} A subgraph node is a node that ``surrounds'' the nodes of a subgraph. The special property of a subgraph node opposed to a normal node is that it is created only after the subgraph has been laid out. However, the difference to a collection like |hyper| is that the node is available immediately as a normal node in the sense that you can connect edges to it. What happens internally is that subgraph nodes get ``registered'' immediately both on the \ level and on the Lua level
