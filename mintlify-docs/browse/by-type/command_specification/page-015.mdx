Uncolored patterns have no inherent color, the color is provided when they are set. Colored patterns have an inherent color. The name is a name for later use when the pattern is to be shown. The pairs $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ must describe a bounding box of the pattern code. The t

} This takes a \ box and converts it into a transparency group. This means that any transparency settings apply to the box as a whole. For instance, if a box contains two overlapping black circles and you draw the box and, thus, the two circles normally with 50\% transparency, then the overlap will be darker than the rest. By comparison, if the circles are part of a transparency group, the overlap will get the same color as the rest.
