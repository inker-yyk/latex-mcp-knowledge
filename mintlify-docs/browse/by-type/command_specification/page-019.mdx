## 951. Command Specification

**ID**: `c30b0bf3f504`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

table2 or filename} table:vertcat Appends the contents of table2 to table1 (``vertical concatenation''). To be more precise, only columns which exist already in table1 will be appended and every column which exists in table1 must exist in table2 (or there must be |alias| or |create on use| specifications to generate them). If the second argument is a file name, that file will be loaded from disk. If table1 does not exist, table2 will be copied to table1. % Remark: The output table table1 will be

**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} Clears a table. Note that it is much more reliable to introduce extra curly braces `|{ ... }|' around table operations -- these braces define the scope of a variable (including tables).

**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

new col name table} Creates a new column named new col name and appends it to an already existing table table. End users probably don't need to use || directly at all -- there is the high-level framework |create on use| which invokes it internally and can be used with simple key--value assignments (see below). However, this documentation explains how to use values of existing columns to fill new cells. This command offers a flexible framework to generate new columns. It has been designed to crea

### Description

macro or input file nameoutput file name} This command takes a table and writes it to a new data file (without performing any typesetting). If the first argument is a file name, that file is loaded first. This command simply invokes || with cleared output parameters. That means any of the column creation methods apply here as well, including any postprocessing steps (without the final typesetting). || uses the keys |reset styles| and |disable rowcol styles| to clear any typesetting related optio

### Description

### Description

oftable as cellcontentcode} Reports every table cell $t_{ij}$ for a fixed column $j$ in read-only mode. For every cell in the column named column name, code will be executed. During this invocation, the macro cellcontent will contain the cell's content and || will contain the current row's index. % % The argument column name can also be a column index. In that case, it should contain |[index]|integer, for example |[index]4|. Furthermore, column aliases and columns which should be generated on th

### Description

oftable as cellcontentcode} A routine which is similar to ||, but any changes of cellcontent which might occur during code will be written back into the respective cell. % If column name is a column alias or has been created on the fly, a new column named column name will be created.

### Description

col oftable} Selects a single table element at row row and column col. The second argument has the same format as that described in the last paragraph: it should be a column name or a column index (in which case it needs to be written as |[index]|number). The return value will be written to ||. % Attention: If possible, avoid using this command inside of loops. It is quite slow.

### Description

|in| list command} A specialized variant of || which can do two things: it does not introduce extra groups while executing command and it allows to invoke the math parser for (simple!) $x_0$|,|$x_1$|,...,|$x_n$ expressions. % A more useful example might be to work with tables: % Remark: The special syntax list=$x_0$|,|$x_1$|,...,|$x_n$, i.e.\@ with two leading elements, followed by dots and a final element, invokes the math parser for the loop.

### Description

command} A variant of || (and such also of ||) which replaces any occurrence of |#1| inside of command once for every element in list. Thus, it actually assumes that command is like a || body. In other words, command is invoked for every element of list. The actual element of list is available as |#1|. As ||, this command does not introduce extra scopes (i.e.\@ it is ungrouped as well). The difference to | in |listcommand is subtle: the || would not be expanded whereas |#1| is. % % The counterex

There is no limit on the number of columns which can be part of a mathematical expression, but only values inside of the currently processed table row can be used.
