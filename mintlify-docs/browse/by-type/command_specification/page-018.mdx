value} This macro (re)defines a key. It is (almost) equivalent to a macro definition of sorts | key@|/key path/key name||value; i.e.\ it stores value into a new macro such that the key can be looked up in constant time in 's hash map. Note that in contrast to other key--value packages like |xkeyval|, the low--level macro name which is used to store the value is not part of the Keys that {key@ is unrelated to Keys.} -- use || and its friends to access the value.

macro} As you might have guessed, this macro allows to retrieve the value for some key and store it into macro. Now that we have read about || and ||, we can also provide an example: There is few magic around these two keys; it is just like a hashmap access with some special naming convention for the keys (due to the key path). Note that since ``hashmap access'' is what \ does all the time when it handles macros, we could have replaced the pair ||/|| by || and suitable || commands, perhaps combi

### Description

} This is essentially the same as ||/key path/key name macro macro; i.e.\ it expands to the value stored in a key. However, this key has one major advantage: it can be used inside of an || (because it is fully expandable): It boils down to a suitable | ... |. Consequently, it expands to || if the key happens to be undefined (see || below).

macro body} This is a variant of ||. However, it has a substantial difference which appears to be unmotivated as long as we discuss the low--level . It defines a so--called code--key. Code--keys are executable macros. They take an argument, and they do something with it. ``Assigning values'' to such a key is equivalent to invoking macro body in a ``suitable'' way. The result of this macro call is a new key named /key path/key name/|.@cmd|. That key, in turn, is stored as executable macro. The ma

} This macro is almost the same as ||comma--separated key--value pairs. In fact, if any assignments in its argument use fully--qualified paths (as we did so far in this document), both invocations are equivalent. The difference is how they treat keys which are relative to some current key path, a concept which will be explained in the next subsection.
