## 701. Command Specification

**ID**: `c819f9711275`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} Called after a |{pgfpicture}| has been typeset. The picture will have been put in box box. This command should insert the box into the normal text. The box box will still be a ``raw'' box that contains only the ||'s that make up the description of the picture. The job of this command is to resize and shift box according to the baseline shift and the size of the box. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

## 702. Command Specification

**ID**: `748aef5c31f3`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

This version of the |@beginpicture| picture command can be used for pictures that are guaranteed not to contain any escaped boxes (see below). In this case, a driver might provide a more compact version of the command. This command has a default implementation and need not be implemented by a driver file.

## 705. Command Specification

**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} Called to insert a (horizontal) TeX box inside a |{pgfpicture}|, but with the current coordinate transformation matrix synced with the canvas transformation matrix. This command should do the same as if you used || followed by |@hbox|. However, the default implementation of this command will use a ``TeX-translation'' for the translation part of the transformation matrix. This will ensure that hyperlinks ``survive'' at least translations. On the other hand, a driver may choose to revert to a si

**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} Basically, this should do the same as doing a (scoped) low level sync followed by inserting the box box number directly into the output stream. However, the default implementation uses |@hboxsynced| in conjunction with |@beginpicture| to ensure that, if possible, hyperlinks survive in pdfs. Drivers that are sensitive to picture-in-picture scopes should replace this implementation by % %

Saves the current graphic state on a graphic state stack. All changes to the graphic state parameters mentioned for |@stroke| and |@fill| will be local to the current graphic state and the old values will be restored after |@endscope| is used. Warning: \ and PostScript differ with respect to the question of whether the current path is part of the graphic state or not. For this reason, you should never use this command unless the path is currently empty. For example, it might be a good idea to us

**Package**: tikz  

### Description

y} This command is used to start a path at a specific point $(x,y)$ or to move the current point of the current path to $(x,y)$ without drawing anything upon stroking (the current path is ``interrupted''). Both x and y are given as \ dimensions. It is the driver's job to transform these to the coordinate system of the backend. Typically, this means converting the \ dimension into a dimensionless multiple of $1{72}in$. The function |@sys@bp| helps with this conversion. Draw a line from $(10pt,10p

ywidthheight} Append a rectangle to the current path whose lower left corner is at $(x,y)$ and whose width and height in big points are given by width and height. This command can be ``mapped back'' to |@moveto| and |@lineto| commands, but it is included since \ has a special, quick version of this command.

## 713. Command Specification

**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

Close the current path. This results in joining the current point of the path with the point specified by the last |@moveto| operation. Typically, this is preferable over using |@lineto| to the last point specified by a |@moveto|, since the line starting at this point and the line ending at this point will be smoothly joined by |@closepath|. Consider % % and % The difference between the above will be that in the second triangle the corner at the origin will be wrong; it will just be the overlay

y scale} This command will scale the canvas (and everything that is drawn) by a factor of x scale in the $x$-direction and y scale in the $y$-direction. Note that this applies to everything, including lines. So a scaled line will have a different width and may even have a different width when going along the $x$-axis and when going along the $y$-axis, if the scaling is different in these directions.

The effect of this command is as follows: Consider the rectangles $R$ with lower left corner $(x_1,y_1)$ and upper right corner $(x_2,y_2)$ and $R'$ with corners $(x'_1,y'_1)$ and $(x'_2,y'_2)$.

**Package**: tikz  

### Description

This command fills the area surrounded by the current path. If the path has not yet been closed, it is closed prior to filling. The path itself is not stroked. For self-intersecting paths or paths consisting of multiple parts, the nonzero winding number rule is used to determine whether a point is inside or outside the path, except if |@eorule| holds -- in which case the even-odd rule should be used.

## 723. Command Specification

**ID**: `22eeb96fd869`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

First, the path is filled, then the path is stroked. If the fill and stroke colors are the same (or if they are not specified and the current color is used), this yields almost the same as a |@fill|. However, due to the line thickness of the stroked path, the fill-stroked area will be slightly larger. In addition to stroking and filling the path, the path will also be used for clipping if |@clipnext| is used prior to this command. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

### Description

Normally, this command should ``throw away'' the current path. However, after |@clipnext| has been called, the current path should subsequently be used for clipping. See |@clipnext| for details. This command is protocolled, see Section~section-protocols.

This command should be issued after a path has been constructed, but before it has been stroked and/or filled or discarded. When the command is used, the next stroking/filling/discarding command will first be executed normally. Then, afterwards, the just-used path will be used for subsequent clipping. If there has already been a clipping region, this region is intersected with the new clipping path (the clipping cannot get bigger). The nonzero winding number rule is used to determine whether a p
