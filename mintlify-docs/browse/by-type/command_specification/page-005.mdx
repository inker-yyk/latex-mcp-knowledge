If a path has already been partly constructed, this command will end the current part of the path and start a new one. % % % The command will apply the current coordinate transformation matrix to coordinate before using it.

This means that only one support point is needed. % % Internally, the quadratic curve is converted into a cubic curve. The only noticeable effect of this is that the points used for computing the bounding box are the control points of the converted curve rather than support.
