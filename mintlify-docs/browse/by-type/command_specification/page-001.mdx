### Description

path 2} This command finds the intersection points on the paths path 1 and path 2. The number of intersection points (``solutions'') that are found will be stored, and each point can be accessed afterward. The code for path 1 and path 2 is executed within a group and so can contain transformations (which will be in addition to any existing transformations). The code should not use the path in any way, unless the path is saved first and restored afterward. will regard solutions as ``a bit special

### Description

} After using the || command, this command will return the point for solution number or the origin if this solution was not found. By default, the intersections are simply returned in the order that the intersection algorithm finds them. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily a ``helpful'' ordering. However the following two commands can be used to order the solutions more helpfully.

We have a look at the case that a complete new arrow tip kind is created and then have a look how the command can be used to create shorthands. a Complete New Arrow Tip Kind. The config is a key--value list in which different keys are used to setup the to-be defined arrow. The following keys can be given: % itemize |name||=|name or |name=|start name|-|end name This defines the name of the arrow ti

### Description

y dimension} This command works like the previous command, only it normally adds two points to the convex hull: First, the point $(x dimension,y dimension)$ and, secondly, the point $(x dimension,-y dimension)$. However, the second point is only added if the arrow is not a harpoon. Thus, in our example we could simplify the convex hull to % % If the y dimension is zero or less, only one point, namely $(x dimension,y dimension)$, is added to the hull. Thus, we could also have used the upper conve

For our |depth| key example, we could use this key as follows: % % Actually, this is still not optimal since the expensive || command is now called each time an arrow tip is used with the |depth| option set. The trick is to do the expensive operation only once and then store only very quick code in the arrow option cache: % % The above code will not (yet) work since || will surely hav

**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} This command works like ||, only the code will be executed ``later'' than the code added by the normal version of the command. This is useful for keys that depend on the length of an arrow: Keys like |width'| want to define the arrow width as a multiple of the arrow length, but when the |width'| key is given, the length may not yet have been specified. By making the computation of the width a ``late'' option, we ensure that || will have been setup correctly.

This command converts the line-width dependent size specification, which may consist of one, two, or three numbers, into a triple of three numbers in curly braces, which gets stored in the macro ||.
