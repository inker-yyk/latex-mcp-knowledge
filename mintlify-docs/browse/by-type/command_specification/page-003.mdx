### Description

function} This command will ``try'' to call the gnuplot program to generate the coordinates of the function. In detail, the following happens: This command works with two files: prefix|.gnuplot| and prefix|.table|. If the optional argument prefix is not given, it is set to ||. Let us start with the situation where none of these files exists. Then \ will first generate the file prefix|.gnuplot|. In this file it writes % % where |#1| is replaced by prefix.

**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

Specifies that the line-to plot handler (and also some other plot handlers) should issue a move-to command for the first point of the plot instead of a line-to. This will start a new part of the current path, which is not always, but often, desirable. This is the default.

} When this handler is installed, each time a plot stream command is called, this command will be appended to macro. Thus, at the end of the stream, macro will contain all the commands that were issued on the stream. You can then install another handler and invoke macro to ``replay'' the stream (possibly many times). % %

## 160. Command Specification

**ID**: `88ce15ab0ef5`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} This macro is similar to ||: it parses expression and returns the result in the macro ||. It differs in two respects. Firstly, || does not parse functions, scientific notation, the prefixes for binary octal, or hexadecimal numbers, nor does it accept the special use of |"|, |?| or |:| characters. Secondly, numbers in expression must specify a unit (except in such instances as |0.5@x|), which greatly simplifies the problem of parsing real numbers. As a result of these restrictions || is about t

### Description

At the end of the parse this command is executed, allowing some custom action to be performed on the result of the parse. When this command is executed, the macro || will hold the result of the parse (as always, without units). The result of the custom action should be used to redefine || appropriately. By default, this command is equivalent to ||. This differs from previous versions, where, if the parsed expression contained no units, the result of the parse was scaled according to the value in

expression} Basically, this command sets the length of the register to the value specified by expression. However, there is some fine print: First, in case expression starts with a |+|, a simple \ assignment is done. In particular, register can be a glue register and expression be something like |+1pt plus 1fil| and the register will be assigned the expected value. Second, when the expression does not start with |+|, it is first parsed using ||, resulting in a (dimensionless) value ||. Now, if t

### Description

After a call of || this if will be true exactly if some unit was encountered in the expression. It is always set globally in each call. Note that any ``mentioning'' of a unit inside an expression will set this -if to true. In particular, even an expressionlike |2pt/1pt|, which arguably should be considered ``scalar'' or ``unit-free'' will still have this -if set to true.
