**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

height} Inserts the necessary ||s for the current driver into the output stream to ``locally'' change the page size. Whether such a ``local'' change is possible depends strongly on the driver. For instance, |dvips| will honor the first call to this command that is part of the shipped-out document and will ignore all other uses. In contrast, |pdftex| will use the current value of the paper size for each page and, additionally, setting the papersize is local to the current \ group.
