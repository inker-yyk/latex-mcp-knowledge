### Description

} This command extends the current path by a path given in the svg-path-data syntax. This syntax is described in detail in Section~8.3 of the svg-specification, Version~1.1. In principle, the complete syntax is supported and the library just provides a parser and a mapping to basic layer commands. For instance, |M 0 10| is mapped to |{0pt{10pt}}|. There are, however, a few things to be aware of: % itemize The computation underlying the arc commands |A| and |a| are not numerically stable, which m

When \ encounters a coordinate specified in this way, the arguments are passed to code as argument |#1|. It is now the job of code to make sense of the arguments. At the end of code, the two \ dimensions |@x| and |@y| should be have the $x$- and $y$-canvas coordinate of the coordinate. It is not necessary, but customary, to parse arguments using the key--value syntax. Ho

} This command works similarly to the || command. However, before inserting the text in box number, the current coordinate transformation matrix is applied to the current canvas transformation matrix (is it ``synced'' with this matrix, hence the name). Thus, this command basically has the same effect as if you first called || followed by ||. However, this command will use || and || commands for the ``translational part'' of the coordinate transformation matrix, instead of adding the translationa
