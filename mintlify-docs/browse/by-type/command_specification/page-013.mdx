This handler will issue a || command for each point of the plot, except possibly for the first. As for the line-to handler, what happens with the first point can be specified using || or ||. Obviously, the || command needs, in addition to the points on the path, some control points. These are generated automatically using a somewhat ``dumb'' algorithm: Suppose you have three points $x$, $y$, and $z$ on the curve such that $y$ is between $x$ and $z$: % In order to determine the control points of
