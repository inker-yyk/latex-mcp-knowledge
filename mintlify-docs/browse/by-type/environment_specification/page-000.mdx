### Description

options} This command works like a |{tikzpicture}|, only the picture is not shown, but instead a fading is defined based on this picture. To set the name of the picture, use the |name| option (which is normally used to set the name of a node). % key{/tikz/name=name} Use this option with the |{tikzfadingfrompicture}| environment to set the name of the fading. You must provide this option. key The following shading is 2cm by 2cm and gets more and more transparent from left to right, but is 50\% tr

The path is then divided into different input paths as follows: The format for each item in decoration list is % quote decorationlength{before

{options}} This environment should only be used inside a |{pgfpicture}|. It has the following effect: % enumerate The environment contents are stroked/filled ``ignoring any outside transparency''. This means, all previous transparency settings are ignored (you can still set transparency inside the group, but never mind). This means that if in the environment contents you stroke a pixel three times in black, it is just black. Stroking it white afterwards yields a white pixel, and so on. When the

### Description

mix-in specification} The mix-in specification is applied to all colors inside the environment. At the beginning of the environment, the mix-in is applied to the current color, i.e., the color that was in effect before the environment started. A mix-in specification is a number between 0 and 100 followed by an exclamation mark and a color name. When a || command is encountered inside a mix-in environment, the number states what percentage of the desired color should be used. The rest is ``filled

Thus, even if it is used inside a |{pgfscope}| or a \ group, the contents will still be added to the ``whole'' picture.

The size of the box is determined in the following manner: While \ parses the environment contents, it keeps track of a bounding box for the graphic. Essentially, this bounding box is the smallest box that contains all coordinates mentioned in the graphics. Some coordinates may be ``mentioned'' by \ itself; for example, when you add circle to the

The dash pattern. The line join and cap. The miter limit. The canvas transformation matrix. The clipping path. itemize % Other parameters may also influence how graphics are rendered, but they are not part of the graphic state.

**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} This environment can be used to temporarily interrupt the construction of the current path. The effect will be that the path currently under construction will be ``stored away'' and restored at the end of the environment. Inside the environment you can construct a new path and do something with it. An example application of this environment is the arrow tip caching. Suppose you ask \ to use a specific arrow tip kind. When the arrow tip needs to be rendered for the first time, \ will ``cache''

} Creates a graphic scope that will have the id last used with || attached to, provided such an id was set and was not already used with another object. In the latter cases, no graphic scope is created. Thus, if you wish to ensure that a graphic scope is created, you must (additionally) call || inside or outside the id scope.

Furthermore, the clipping path is also local to the environment, that is, any clipping done inside the environment ``ends'' at its end. % key{/tikz/name=scope name} Assigns a name to a scope reference in animations. The name is a ``high-level'' name that drivers do not see, so you can use spaces, number, letters, in a name, but you should not use any punctuation like a dot, a comma, or a colon. key The following style

options} Once you have loaded the |groupplots| library you will gain access to this environment. This environment is limited to the same restrictions as the |axis| environment. It actually utilizes this environment so consider it as an extension of this. What is important to note is that options are applied to all plots in the entire environment. This can be really handy when you need the same |xmin|, |xmax|, |ymin| and |ymax|.

In fact, it is equivalent to |axis[|options|,axis type=smithchart]|. % % The example above visualizes three data points using the initial configuration of Smith charts; the data points are interpreted as complex numbers $z = x + j y$ and are mapped using $r(z)$.

### Description

options} The axis environment for ternary axes. % A |ternaryaxis| works with relative coordinates: each data point consists of three components $x$, $y$, $z$. Their sum forms a compound entity which has $100\%$ (of whatever). In the standard configuration, we have $x,y,z [0,1]$. The unit interval is not necessary: you can as well choose absolute data ranges $x [x_{},x_{}]$, $y [y_{},y_{}]$ and $z [z_{},z_{}]$. The important thing is that the relative values % \[ x := x-x_{}{x_{} - x_{}},\; y :=
