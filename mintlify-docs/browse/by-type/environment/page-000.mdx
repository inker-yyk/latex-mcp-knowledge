### Description

} This environment will insert a \ box containing the graphic drawn by the environment contents at the current position. The size of the bounding box. The size of the box is determined in the following manner: While \ parses the environment contents, it keeps track of a bounding box for the graphic. Essentially, this bounding box is the smallest box that contains all coordinates mentioned in the graphics. Some coordinates may be ``mentioned'' by \ itself; for example, when you add circle to the

## 14. Environment

**ID**: `cfdff5fa9d3d`  
**Type**: environment  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This environment can be used to temporarily interrupt the construction of the current path. The effect will be that the path currently under construction will be ``stored away'' and restored at the end of the environment. Inside the environment you can construct a new path and do something with it. An example application of this environment is the arrow tip caching. Suppose you ask \ to use a specific arrow tip kind. When the arrow tip needs to be rendered for the first time, \ will ``cache''

**Type**: environment  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

{options}} This environment should only be used inside a |{pgfpicture}|. It has the following effect: enumerate The environment contents are stroked/filled ``ignoring any outside transparency''. This means, all previous transparency settings are ignored (you can still set transparency inside the group, but never mind). This means that if in the environment contents you stroke a pixel three times in black, it is just black. Stroking it white afterwards yields a white pixel, and so on. When the gr

**Type**: environment  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

{animations spec}{options}} All \ commands should be given inside this environment, except for the || command. You cannot use graphics commands like the low-level command || outside this environment and doing so will result in chaos. For , commands like || are only defined inside this environment, so there is little chance that you will do something wrong here. When this environment is encountered, the options are parsed, see Section~section-graphic-options. All options given here will apply to
