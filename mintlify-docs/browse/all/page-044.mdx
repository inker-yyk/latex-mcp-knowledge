From now on, all subsequent interface calls will refer to this scope until || is called, which will pop the scope once more. Inside the \ scope, nodes are not placed immediately.

### Description

This command first starts a new \ scope and then informs the display layer that a new (sub)layout should be started. For each graph there may be a hierarchy of layouts, each of which contains a certain number of vertices and edges. This hierarchy is created through calls to this macros and the corresponding calls of ||. For each graph drawing scope there has to be exactly one main layout that encompasses all nodes and edges and also all sublayouts. Thus, after a graph drawing scope has been open

### Description

} This command can only be called when the node named node name has already been created inside the current graph drawing scope. The effect of calling this macro will be that all options currently on the graph drawing system's option stack will be added to the node's option, possibly overwriting the original option settings. Furthermore, the node will become part of all layouts currently on the option stack. This means that you can use this command to add a node to several layouts that are not i

node optionsnode text} A subgraph node is a node that ``surrounds'' the nodes of a subgraph. The special property of a subgraph node opposed to a normal node is that it is created only after the subgraph has been laid out. However, the difference to a collection like |hyper| is that the node is available immediately as a normal node in the sense that you can connect edges to it. What happens internally is that subgraph nodes get ``registered'' immediately both on the \ level and on the Lua level

## 2246. Command Specification

**ID**: `dfea0f9c0b59`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

}} Rounds a fixed point number to prescribed precision and writes the result to ||. The desired precision can be configured with |/pgf/number format/precision|, see section~pgfmath-numberprinting. This section does also contain application examples. Any trailing zeros after the period are discarded. The algorithm is purely text based and allows to deal with precisions beyond 's fixed point support. As a side effect, the global boolean || will be set to true if and only if the resulting mantissa

## 2248. Command Specification

**ID**: `7b1cddce6776`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

}} Rounds a normalized floating point number to a prescribed precision and writes the result to ||. The desired precision can be configured with |/pgf/number format/precision|, see section~pgfmath-numberprinting. This method employs || to round the mantissa and applies renormalization if necessary. As a side effect, the global boolean || will be set to true if and only if the resulting mantissa has a period. % % %

## 2249. Command Specification

**ID**: `86c544b890ed`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

}} A variant of || produces always the same number of digits after the period (it includes zeros if necessary). % % %

## 2250. Command Specification

**ID**: `48e56f395b07`  
**Type**: command_specification  
**Package**: tikz  

### Description

} Methods of this form constitute the replacement operations where op can be any of the well-known math operations. Thus, is the counterpart for || and so on. The semantics and number of arguments is the same, but all input and output arguments are expected to be floating point numbers.
