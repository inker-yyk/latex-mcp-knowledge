## 2403. Command

**ID**: `b2c51bba51cc`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

coordinatenormal distance } Provides a point coordinate on one of the available four axes in case of a two dimensional figure or on one of the available twelve axes in case of a three dimensional figure. The desired axis is uniquely identified by a three character string, provided as first argument to the command. The first of the three characters is `|0|' if the $x$-coordinate of the specified axis passes through the lower axis limit. It is `|1|', if the $x$-coordinate of the specified axis pas

## 2404. Command

**ID**: `1641b10a0569`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

axis fractionnormal distance } This point coordinate is a variant of || which allows to provide an axis fraction instead of an absolute coordinate. The fraction is a number between $0$ (lower axis limit) and $1$ (upper axis limit), i.e.\@ it is given in percent of the total axis. It is possible to provide negative values or values larger than one. The || command is similar in spirit to |rel axis cs|. There is one speciality in conjunction with reversed axes: if the axis has been reversed by |x d

## 2405. Command

**ID**: `fc7dfa2918d8`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} A point command which yields the outer normal vector of the respective axis. The normal vector has length $1$ (computed with ||). It is the same normal vector used inside of || and its variants. The output of this command will be cached and reused during the lifetime of an axis.


---

## 2406. Command

**ID**: `e1db2ec0f710`

## 2408. Command

**ID**: `2498b93248b1`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

A macro which is very similar to ||. Consequently, it is also supposed to be called during the visualization phase. It assigns the very same output macros, but the values are different. More precisely, it defines the macros /data point/x will contain the current point's normalized $x$-coordinate. /data point/y will contain the current point's normalized $y$-coordinate. /data point/z will contain the current point's normalized $z$-coordinate (if applicable). /data point/meta will contain the curr

## 2409. Command

**ID**: `9e3eb47aa6e0`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots

## 2411. Command

**ID**: `5c66c4f6096a`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} A low-level command of which will collect everything until the matching || into layer layer name. The layer name must be active, i.e.\@ it must be part of the layer names of |set layers|. The only special case is if you call |discard| somewhere: this special layer has a ``magical name'' which serves as |/dev/null| if it is enabled using |discard|: it does not need to be active and everything assigned to this layer will be thrown away if it is not part of the layer name configuration. There mus

### Description

name} Adds a single legend entry to the legend list. This will also enable legend drawing. codeexample[] tikzpicture axis [smooth,mark=*,blue] coordinates { (0,2) (2,3) (3,1) }; Case 1 [smooth,color=red,mark=x] coordinates { (0,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,2) }; Case 2 axis tikzpicture codeexample It does not matter where || commands are placed, only the sequence matters. You will need one || for every || command (unless you prefer an empty legend). The optional options affect how the text is drawn; they a


---

## 2554. Command

**ID**: `525d94510584`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

{ text}} A variant of || which provides a method to deal with macros inside of { text}. Suppose { text} contains some sort of parameter which varies for every plot. Moreover, you like to use a loop to generate the plots. Then, it is simpler to use ||: codeexample[] tikzpicture axis in {1,2,3} { {x^}; $x^$ } axis tikzpicture codeexample Note that this example wouldn't have worked with |$x^$| because the macro || is no longer defined when attempts to draw the legend. The invocation |$x^$| is equiv


---

## 2555. Command

**ID**: `1de6f03ce919`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} You can use ||list to assign a complete legend. codeexample[code only] $d=2$,$d=3$,$d=4$,$d=5$,$d=6$ codeexample The argument of || is a list of entries, one for each plot. Two different delimiters are supported: enumerate There are comma-separated lists like codeexample[code only] $d=2$,$d=3$,$d=4$,$d=5$,$d=6$ codeexample These lists are processed using the || command and are quite powerful. The || command supports a dots notation to denote ranges like |1,2,...,5| or even |$x^1$,$x^...$,$x^d$

## 2556. Command

**ID**: `56d340789afc`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} Can be used to reference a labeled, single plot. See the example above. This will also work together with |hyperref| links and ||.Older versions of { required the use of protect ref when used inside of captions or section headings. This is no longer necessary.}


---

## 2557. Command

**ID**: `dc13ba490913`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} This command poses an equivalent alternative for ||name: it has essentially the same effect, but it does not create links when used with the |hyperref| package.Since this manual uses colored links, the text in { would usually be blue. Using avoids link text colors in the legend (this has been applied to the manual styles here).}


---

## 2558. Command

**ID**: `14bf14545431`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} Adds a further legend image for legend creation. Each || command appends its plot style options to a list, and || adds options to the very same list. Thus, the effect is as if you had provided ||options, but || bypasses all the logic usually associated with a plot. In other words: except for the legend, the state of the axis remains as if the command would not have been issued. Not even the current plot's index is advanced. codeexample[] tikzpicture semilogyaxis[ domain=0:4, ] {x}; $x$ {x^2};
