## 3429. Command

**ID**: `a8a9188a75c0`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command extends the current path in a straight line to the given coordinate.

## 3431. Command

**ID**: `107479182dbe`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

coordinate} This command works like ||, only it uses a quadratic Bézier curve rather than a cubic one. This means that only one support point is needed. codeexample[] pgfpicture {1cm{1cm}}{2cm{0cm}} yellow!80!black fill,stroke pgfpicture codeexample Internally, the quadratic curve is converted into a cubic curve. The only noticeable effect of this is that the points used for computing the bounding box are the control points of the converted curve rather than support. The main effect of this is t

## 3434. Command

**ID**: `cd521805315e`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

This command closes the current part of the path by appending a straight line to the start point of the current part. Note that there is a difference between closing a path and using the line-to operation to add a straight line to the start of the current path. The difference is demonstrated by the upper corners of the triangles in the following example: codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 5pt {1cm{1cm}} {0cm{-1cm}} {1cm{-1cm}} {2.5cm{1cm}} {1.5cm{-1cm}} {2.5cm{-1cm}} {2.5cm

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

end angle{`\{}radius| and |{y-radius}{`\}}} This command appends a part of a circle (or an ellipse) to the current path. Imagine the curve between start angle and end angle on a circle of radius radius (if $start angle < end angle$, the curve goes around the circle counterclockwise, otherwise clockwise). This curve is now moved such that the point where the curve starts is the previous last point of the path. Note that this command will not start a new part of the path, which is important for ex

## 3436. Command

**ID**: `588298c30766`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

end anglefirst axissecond axis} This command is similar to ||. The main difference is how the ellipse or circle is specified from which the arc is taken. The two parameters first axis and second axis are the $0^$-axis and the $90^$-axis of the ellipse from which the path is taken. Thus, |0{90}{1cm and 2cm}| has the same effect as verbatim 0{90}{1cm{0cm}}{0cm{2cm}} verbatim codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); (0,0) -- (2cm,5mm) (0,0) -- (0cm,1cm); {2cm{5mm}} 0{90}{2cm{5mm}}{0

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

y-radiusrotation large arc flagcounterclockwise flag\ point} This command (which directly corresponds to the arc-path command of svg) is used to add an arc to the path that starts at the current point and ends at target point. This arc is part of an ellipse that is determined in the following way: Imagine an ellipse with radii x-radius and y-radius that is rotated around its center by rotation degrees. When you move this ellipse around in the plane, there will be exactly two positions such that

### Description

start angleend angleend point\-radiusy-radiusratio x-radius/y-radiusratio y-radius/x-radius} A specialized arc operation which is fast and numerically stable, provided a lot of information is given in advance. In contrast to ||, it explicitly interpolates start and end points. In contrast to ||, this routine is numerically stable and quite fast since it relies on a lot of available information. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); 1.5cm 1cm 0 270 1.5cm 0.5cm /= /= {+*cos(){+*

## 3439. Command

**ID**: `a36daab1d110`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

first axissecond axis} The effect of this command is to append an ellipse to the current path (if the path is not empty, a new part is started). The ellipse's center will be center and first axis and second axis are the axis vectors. The same effect as this command can also be achieved using an appropriate sequence of move-to, arc, and close operations, but this command is easier and faster. codeexample[] tikzpicture [help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2); {1cm{0cm}} {1.5cm{0cm}} {0cm{1cm}} draw red {1cm

### Description

first cornersecond corner} Appends a grid to the current path. That is, a (possibly large) number of parts are added to the path, each part consisting of a single horizontal or vertical straight line segment. Conceptually, the origin is part of the grid and the grid is clipped to the rectangle specified by the first corner and the second corner. However, no clipping occurs (this command just adds parts to the current path) and the points where the lines enter and leave the ``clipping area'' are

**Type**: command  
**Package**: tikz-pgf  

### Description

} This command causes all subsequent corners to be replaced by little arcs. The effect of this command lasts till the end of the current \ scope. The point dictates how large the corner arc will be. Consider a corner made by two lines $l$ and~$r$ and assume that the line $l$ comes first on the path. The $x$-dimension of the point decides by how much the line~$l$ will be shortened, the $y$-dimension of point decides by how much the line $r$ will be shortened. Then, the shortened lines are connect

Determines whether the position of pictures on the page should be recorded. The value of this -if at the end of a |{pgfpicture}| environment is important, not the value at the beginning. If this option is set to true of a picture, \ will attempt to record the position of the picture on the page. (This attempt will fail with most drivers and when it works, it typically requires two runs of .) The position is not directly accessible. Rather, the nodes mechanism will use this position if you access
