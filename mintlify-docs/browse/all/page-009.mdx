## 1821. Command

**ID**: `4696e889ed38`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} There are 256 Integer registers which provide 32 Bit Integer arithmetics. The registers can be used for example with |0=42 | or |7= | where || expands to a number. The value of a register can be typeset using ||register. codeexample[] 0=42 The value is now `0'. -123456 0= The value is now `0'. codeexample The `|=|' sign is optional and can be omitted. One thing is common among the registers: an assignment of the form |0=|$$ expands everything which follows until the expansion doesn't need more


---

## 1822. Command

**ID**: `6e1de2ebd8b2`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} There are also 255 registers for fixed point numbers which are used pretty much in the same way as the || registers -- but || register assignments require a unit like `|cm|' or `|pt|'. String access with `||' works in exactly the same way as for || registers. codeexample[] 0=1pt The value is now 0. 0=0.0001pt The value is now 0. 1234.5678 0= pt The value is now 0. codeexample The same rules with expansion of macros after assignments apply here as well. The || registers perform their arithmetic

## 1823. Command

**ID**: `88e7e01523dc`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} cmd:toks There are also 255 token registers which can be thought of as special string variables. Of course, every macro assignment ||content is also some kind of string variable, but token registers are special: their contents won't be expanded when used with ||number. This can be used for fine grained expansion control, see Section~sec:expansion:control below. codeexample[] 0={abc} 1={DEF} The value is now 0 1. codeexample Note the white space after |0|: its purpose is to stop the number pars

---

## 1829. Command

**ID**: `c49a44e4494c`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

argument patternreplacement text} A new macro named macroname will be defined (or re-defined). The replacement text is the macro body, whenever the macro is executed, it expands to replacement text. The replacement text is a token list which can contain other macros. On the time of the definition, \ does not process (expand) the replacement text. The replacement text will only be expanded if the macro is executed. This does also apply to any macros which are inside of replacement text. codeexamp

## 1830. Command

**ID**: `ba7439b69dba`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

next token} The || command is an -- at first sight confusing -- method to alter the input token list. But: it solves our problem with ||! codeexample[] (#1,#2){we do something with #1 and #2} (42,1234) codeexample Why did that work!? The command || scans for the token after || in the input token list. This is || in our case. Then, it scans for the next token which is || in our case (remember: macros are considered to be elementary tokens, just like characters `|a|' or so). The two scanned argume

## 1831. Command

**ID**: `a15d871ecf17`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

argument patternreplacement text} The || command is the same as || insofar as it defines a new macro. However, it expands replacement text until only unexpandable tokens remain (|| $=$ expanded definition). codeexample[] 3 2 1 = Macro `d' is defined to be `' = Macro `d' is e-defined to be `' Macro `d' is defined to be `' using expandafter codeexample This listing results in the log-file output |Macro `d' is defined to be `macro:->value= '| |Macro `d' is e-defined to be `macro:->value=123'| |Macr


---

## 1832. Command

**ID**: `70bce8f2503c`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} The || command is only useful inside of the replacement text of an || command. As soon as || encounters the ||, the || will be removed and the expandable token will be converted into an unexpandable token. Thus, the code codeexample[] another macro Macro `d' is defined to be `' codeexample yields the terminal output |Macro `d' is defined to be `macro:->Invoke another macro'| because || yields the token `||' (unexpanded)The { noexpand key is actually used to implement the \ command protect: 's

---

## 1835. Command

**ID**: `5069afa73d2d`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

=token} Defines or redefines || to be an equivalent to token. For example, |=| will create a new copy of macro ||. The copy is named ||, and it will have exactly the same replacement text and argument pattern as ||. It is also possible that token is something different than a macro, for example a named register or a single character.


---

## 1836. Command

**ID**: `d11546c58ea6`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

## 1838. Command

**ID**: `e0fe23a1840e`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

endcsname} This command is not a macro definition, it is a definition of a macro's name. The ``cs'' means ``control sequence''. The ||, || pair defines a control sequence name (a macro name) using expandable tokens. The control sequence character `|\|' will be prepended automatically by ||.In fact, the contents of { escapechar will be used here. If its value is -1, no character will be prepended. The same holds for any occurrence where a backslash would be inserted by \ commands.} codeexample[] 


---

## 1839. Command

**ID**: `c4338a7af23f`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

} This command does not define a macro. Instead, it returns a macro's name as a sequence of separate tokens, including the control sequence token `|\|'. codeexample[] I have just defined `' using `'. codeexample You can also use || on other tokens -- for example characters. That doesn't hurt, the character will be returned as-is.

## 1847. Command

**ID**: `90c19501e2da`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

A special variant of || which can also be used to delimit arguments to || or || (i.e. it avoids the necessity to provide matched curly braces in this context). The || macro is also useful to test whether the next following character is an opening brace (see ||). If one just needs to open a \ group, one should prefer ||.

## 1850. Command

**ID**: `f8454be07a73`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

(initially 0)} I cite from~texbook: ``If the || parameter is positive at the time of an assignment, a prefix of || is automatically implied; but if || is negative at the time of the assignment, a prefix of || is ignored. If || is zero (which it usually is), the appearance of nonappearance of || determines whether or not a global assignment is made.''

## 1853. Command

**ID**: `697c85da0b19`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

token2true-block elsefalse-block fi} || is a bit more complex: It compares two tokens up to their first-level expansion. codeexample[] This is shown if the two tokens have equal expansion. This is shown if the two tokens expand to something different. codeexample Here, we have defined a token || to be a replacement for || and subsequently have compared whether these two tokens are equal in first-level expansion. Note that the definition is actually nonsense. If ever were to go through the whole

## 1854. Command

**ID**: `39cd67f17c22`  
**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

token2true-block elsefalse-block fi} The || comparison is closely related to the || conditional, with one major exception: it expands tokens until it finds the next two unexpandable tokens. If these two tokens are the same, it expands to the true-block, otherwise to the false-block. The || conditional should be handled with care as it might produce undesirable effects. Use it only if you know what you do. A useful example is if you know that a macro contains at most one character, and you want t

**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

value} This macro (re)defines a key. It is (almost) equivalent to a macro definition of sorts | key@|/key path/key name||value; i.e.\ it stores value into a new macro such that the key can be looked up in constant time in 's hash map. Note that in contrast to other key--value packages like |xkeyval|, the low--level macro name which is used to store the value is not part of the Keys that {key@ is unrelated to Keys.} -- use || and its friends to access the value. The only limit for the number of p

### Description

macro} As you might have guessed, this macro allows to retrieve the value for some key and store it into macro. Now that we have read about || and ||, we can also provide an example: codeexample[] /notes/key{abc} /notes/key The value of key /notes/key is `'. codeexample There is few magic around these two keys; it is just like a hashmap access with some special naming convention for the keys (due to the key path). Note that since ``hashmap access'' is what \ does all the time when it handles mac

### Description

} This is essentially the same as ||/key path/key name macro macro; i.e.\ it expands to the value stored in a key. codeexample[] /notes/key{abc} The value of key /notes/key is `/notes/key'. codeexample However, this key has one major advantage: it can be used inside of an || (because it is fully expandable): codeexample[] /notes/key{abc} --- {/notes/key ---} The value of key /notes/key along with dashes is . codeexample It boils down to a suitable | ... |. Consequently, it expands to || if the k

**Type**: command  
**Package**: pgfplots  

### Description

macro body} This is a variant of ||. However, it has a substantial difference which appears to be unmotivated as long as we discuss the low--level . It defines a so--called code--key. Code--keys are executable macros. They take an argument, and they do something with it. ``Assigning values'' to such a key is equivalent to invoking macro body in a ``suitable'' way. The result of this macro call is a new key named /key path/key name/|.@cmd|. That key, in turn, is stored as executable macro. The ma

### Description

} This macro is almost the same as ||comma--separated key--value pairs. In fact, if any assignments in its argument use fully--qualified paths (as we did so far in this document), both invocations are equivalent. The difference is how they treat keys which are relative to some current key path, a concept which will be explained in the next subsection. Here is the difference between the macros: || resets the current key path to |/| before processing its argument whereas || does not change the cur
